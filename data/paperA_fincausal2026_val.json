In contrast, products associated with leisure and culture increased their prices the most in the final third of the year, driven by the rise in tourism package prices. In December 2018, the highest year-on-year inflation was recorded in the Canary Islands, Catalonia and Madrid (all at 1.4%), as well as Navarre, which also ended the year above the Spanish average (1.3%).
