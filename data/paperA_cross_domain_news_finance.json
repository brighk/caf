    "text": "On the other hand, it 's turning out to be another very bad financial week for Asia. The financial assistance from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are not helping. In the last twenty four hours, the value of the Indonesian stock market has fallen by twelve percent. The Indonesian currency has lost twenty six percent of its value. In Singapore, stocks hit a five year low. In the Philippines, a four year low. And in Hong Kong, a three percent drop. More problems in Hong Kong for a place, for an economy, that many experts thought was once invincible. Here 's ABC 's Jim Laurie. Not that long ago, before the Chinese takeover, the news about real estate here was that the sky was the limit the highest prices in the world. So when Wong Kwan spent seventy million dollars for this house, he thought it was a great deal. He sold the property to five buyers and said he 'd double his money. In Hong Kong, is always belongs to the seller 's market. Now with new construction under way, three of his buyers have backed out. And Wong Kwan will be lucky to break even. All across Hong Kong, the property market has crashed. Pamela Pak owns eight condominiums here. Pak ca n't find buyers. She estimates her properties, worth a hundred thirty million dollars in October, are worth only half that now. They believe ah it will be always up going up and up ah forever. Nobody believe this any more. Of all of Asia 's economies, Hong Kong is the most robust. But in the past three months, stocks have plunged, interest rates have soared and the downturn all across Asia means that people are not spending here. Hotels are only thirty percent full. You can get seventy percent discounts at the shopping malls. Three thousand dollar pearls for eight hundred dollars. A two hundred dollar wool jacket for fifty dollars. Still, there are few buyers. And at the big brokerage houses, after ten years of boom, they 're talking about layoffs. I think that the mood is fairly gloomy, and I think it 's not going to change for a couple of years. So for Hong Kong, it 's time, as investment bankers like to say, to reposition. To either hold on tight or get out, as much of Asia goes into recession. Jim Laurie, ABC News, Hong Kong.",

    "text": "For his part, Fidel Castro is the ultimate political survivor. People have predicted his demise so many times, and the US has tried to hasten it on several occasions. Time and again, he endures. He has outlasted and sometimes outsmarted eight American presidents. Fidel Castro invited John Paul to come for a reason. This is clearly an opportunity for Cuba to look good internationally. The entire world will see images of the Pope in Cuba. They 'll see images of the Pope with Fidel Castro. It will give the rest of the world the view that Cuba is like any other nation, something the US has, of course, tried to persuade the world that it is not. For nearly forty years, the United States has said categorically it would not tolerate totalitarian rule in its own backyard. It is the US economic and political embargo which has kept Cuba in a box. The main positive for Castro to invite the Pope is international, to be able to say to the rest of the world, this government is not as closed, as intolerant, uh as totalitarian as some make it out to be. One of the scenarios widely advanced before the visit is that through the Pope, Cuba, still led by Castro, can begin a more productive relationship with the world. That will, in turn, bring pressure on Washington to change. Those observers looking for a battle between uncompromising representatives and very different ideologies will, in all likelihood, be disappointed. Castro has said that you can be a Communist and still be a Christian. He says he and the Pope both want to end the exploitation of man by man. The question is who will Cubans believe? The main negative is the risk that the Pope 's visit will persuade a great many more Cubans to break loose of the Cuban government. If so, then the Pope 's visit would really open up a new chapter in the government 's relations with its own society. For the Cuban government, that is the risk. At the end of the broadcast this evening, one more trip around Havana to see what it 's been like since the last time. And in just a moment Diane Sawyer will have some other news.",

Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Eileen Collins will be named commander of the Space Shuttle Columbia for a mission in December. Colonel Collins has been the co-pilot before, but this time she 's the boss. Here 's ABC 's Ned Potter. Even two hundred miles up in space, there has been a glass ceiling. It was n't until twenty years after the first astronauts were chosen that NASA finally included six women, and they were all scientists, not pilots. No woman has actually been in charge of a mission until now. Just the fact that we 're doing the job that we 're doing makes us role models. That was Eileen Collins, after she flew as the first ever co-pilot. Being commander is different. It means supervising the rest of the crew in training and leading them in flight. It is, in short, the kind of management job many American women say they 've had to fight for. In space, some say female pilots were held up until now by the lack of piloting opportunities for them in the military. Once Colonel Collins was picked as a NASA astronaut, she followed a normal progression within NASA. Nobody hurried her up. No one held her back. Many NASA watchers say female astronauts have become part of the agency 's routine. But they still have catching up to do two hundred and thirty four Americans have flown in space, only twenty six of them women. Ned Potter, ABC News.",

    "text": "Iraq 's Saddam Hussein, facing U.S. and Arab troops at the Saudi border, today sought peace on another front by promising to withdraw from Iranian territory and release soldiers captured during the Iran - Iraq war. Also today, King Hussein of Jordan arrived in Washington seeking to mediate the Persian Gulf crisis. President Bush on Tuesday said the United States may extend its naval quarantine to Jordan 's Red Sea port of Aqaba to shut off Iraq 's last unhindered trade route. In another mediation effort, the Soviet Union said today it had sent an envoy to the Middle East on a series of stops to include Baghdad. Soviet officials also said Soviet women, children and invalids would be allowed to leave Iraq. President Bush today denounced Saddam 's \" ruinous policies of war, \" and said the United States is \" striking a blow for the principle that might does not make right. \" In a speech delivered at the Pentagon, Bush seemed to suggest that American forces could be in the gulf region for some time. \" No one should doubt our staying power or determination, \" he said. The U.S. military buildup in Saudi Arabia continued at fever pace, with Syrian troops now part of a multinational force camped out in the desert to guard the Saudi kingdom from any new thrust by Iraq. In a letter to President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran, read by a broadcaster over Baghdad radio, Saddam said he will begin withdrawing troops from Iranian territory on Friday and release Iranian prisoners of war. Iran said an Iraqi diplomatic delegation was en route to Tehran to deliver Saddam 's message, which it said it would review \" with optimism. \" Saddam appeared to accept a border demarcation treaty he had rejected in peace talks following the August 1988 cease-fire of the eight-year war with Iran. The move seemed aimed at heading off more trouble with Iran, which had condemned Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 but also criticized the multinational force dispatched to Saudi Arabia. Saddam said he sought to \" turn the gulf into a lake of peace free of foreign fleets and forces that harbor ill intentions against us. \" In other developments: The Pentagon said that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is considering urging Bush to order a national callup of armed forces reserves for active duty because of the drain on units sending soldiers abroad. Bush can call up to 200,000 reservists for up to 180 days without seeking congressional approval. Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said special ambassador Mikhail Sytenko left Tuesday for consultations with the governments of Syria, Jordan, Egypt and other Arab countries. Sytenko, a former deputy secretary-general of the United Nations, is also expected to visit Baghdad, Gremitskikh said at a regular news briefing today. The outlook darkened for about 3,000 Americans caught in Iraq and Kuwait when Saddam sent his forces into the small, oil-rich sultanate. The Iraqi ambassador to Greece said in Athens the Americans and other stranded foreigners could leave \" as soon as the threats from the United States and its allies are eliminated. \" ABC quoted an Iraqi Foreign Ministry official in Baghdad as saying Americans in Iraq are \" restrictees \" who will stay there until the crisis ends. The Soviet Foreign Ministry said Soviet women, children and invalids would be permitted to leave Iraq. Spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said the first group of 230 evacuees was assembling in Baghdad today, but evacuation plans were hampered by desert heat and lack of transportation. Nearly 9,000 Soviets were among the hundreds of thousands of foreigners trapped in Iraq and Kuwait. Iraq has agreed to allow all 880 Soviets in Kuwait to leave, but only by a 1,200-mile road route through Iraq and to the Iraq - Jordan border. The British Foreign Office said today conditions in Kuwait appear to be deteriorating. There have been reports of wholesale looting but food and gasoline were still available, said a spokesman, who by custom was not identified. Banks remained closed. The Iraqi ambassador to Venezuela said on Tuesday that Iraq would retaliate against Venezuela and other OPEC oil cartel members if they boost oil production to fill the gap created by blocked supplies from Iraq and Kuwait. With Kuwait now \" annexed, \" Iraq has control of 20 percent of the world 's oil reserves. A steep rise in world oil prices followed the Kuwait invasion. The U.N. Security Council on Aug. 6 ordered a global embargo on trade with Iraq as punishment for seizing Kuwait. Bush then sent U.S. troops and planes to Saudi Arabia, saying Iraqi troops massed nearby in Kuwait threatened Saudi Arabia and its vast oil reserves. Twelve Arab League nations voted for an Arab force to protect Saudi Arabia, with the vanguard of Syria 's contingent arriving Tuesday, according to diplomatic sources in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. Egyptian and Moroccan troops are already there. The predominantly Moslem nation of Bangladesh said today its troops would join multinational forces in Saudi Arabia. The size of the contingent was not disclosed. Turkey and Saudi Arabia in effect shut down Iraq 's major oil outlets through those countries, but according to Jordanian officials, a smaller line into Jordan remained operating. Truckloads of goods rolled into Iraq from Jordan on Tuesday and Iraqi-bound cargo was unloaded from ships at the Red Sea port ofAqaba despite the U.N.-ordered sanctions. King Hussein was reportedly carrying a message to Bush from Iraq 's Saddam, with whom the king met Monday. The monarch will meet Bush on Thursday in Kennebunkport, Maine. Crown Prince Hassan, King Hussein 's brother and political adviser, was asked today about the message the king was said to be carrying. In an interview from Jordan on ABC, he declined to discuss details, but said: \" I do n't think that his majesty would be traveling at this crucial moment if the Iraqi leadership did not have a rational approach to the future. \" A CBS News report citing unidentified Jordanian sources said that Saddam 's message called for an international conference to be convened to discuss an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. In exchange, the buildup of U.S. forces in the region would halt. Bush, however, says he sees no short-term hope for a diplomatic solution to the gulf crisis _ at least until economic sanctions force Saddam to withdraw his army. Bush held out the prospect of more aid to Jordan if it cooperates with the trade embargo. On Tuesday, the United States and Soviet Union conferred in Washington on putting an anti-Iraq naval blockade under a United Nations umbrella. The United States has provided most of the naval vessels so far to block Iraqi trade, with Britain, West Germany and Australia among the other nations lending support at sea. The embargo is meant to cripple Iraq by cutting off its exports of oil and imports of food and military supplies. Iraq imports about three-quarters of its foodstuffs. U.S. allies and other U.N. members have objected that the Security Council embargo resolution did not specifically authorize such a naval operation. Bush told a news conference on Tuesday that the naval barricade now in force might be extended to Jordan 's Aqaba \" if it is a hole through which commerce flows \" in and out of Iraq. In Saudi Arabia, today is the eighth day of \" Desert Shield, \" the operation designed to confront an estimated 200,000 Iraqi soldiers now in Kuwait. Iraq boasts an army of 1 million members. At least 50,000 U.S. troops are expected to be committed to Desert Shield within weeks, including Marines, Army air assault forces, paratroopers and infantry. Iraq said it invaded Kuwait because of disputes over oil and money. It accused Kuwait of deliberately slashing Iraqi oil revenues by overproducing oil and driving down prices, among other charges. Iraq has 17 million residents, and Kuwait about 1.9 million.",

    "text": "The Persian Gulf showdown between Iraq and the United States took a more personal turn Thursday when Iraq 's Saddam Hussein called President Bush a liar and said the outbreak of holy war could bring thousands of Americans home in coffins. Bush, commenting on the two-week gulf crisis from his vacation home in Maine, said he saw little reason to be optimistic about a settlement of the dispute, which stems from Iraq 's invasion of oil-wealthy Kuwait and its subsequent military buildup on the border of Saudi Arabia. After a two-hour meeting at his Kennebunkport home with King Hussein of Jordan, Bush said, \" I did not come away with any feeling of hope \" that Iraq would withdraw its army from Kuwait. Bush also said Thursday that King Hussein assured him Jordan would close the last remaining free port to most Iraqi trade as the economic embargo on materials to Iraq continued unabated. Foodstuffs are among the goods being blocked from entry; Iraq imports about three-quarters of its food. Pentagon sources in Washington meanwhile said the Bush administration plans to deploy 45,000 Marines to the region to back up the thousands of Army, Navy and Air Force troops already in place in the gulf and the Saudi desert. At a news conference, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Jordan \" is seeking some guidance \" about a provision in the U.N.-backed trade embargo that allows food for humanitarian purposes. Worries however grew about the safety of Americans and other Westerners trapped in Kuwait. Iraqi military authorities ordered all Americans and Britons in Kuwait to assemble at a hotel, officials said. \" Very few \" of the 2,500 Americans in occupied Kuwait complied with the order, a senior U.S. official told The Associated Press. Iraq said the roundup was to protect them from unspecified threats; British Foreign Office minister William Waldegrave called the order \" grave and sinister. \" \" What we fear is that they will be interned somewhere, most likely in Iraq, \" Waldegrave said. A total of about 3,000 Americans, 3,000 Britons and more than 450 Japanese are in Iraq and Kuwait. Overall, more than 2 million foreigners are in both countries. Iraq has called them \" restrictees. \" In addition to the estimated 45,000 Marines to ultimately be part of Operation Desert Shield, Stealth fighter planes and the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy are also headed to Saudi Arabia to protect it from Iraqi expansionism. In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Iraq has continued to increase its armed forces in Kuwait and they now number about 160,000. Saddam has been under international quarantine since his Aug. 2 power-grab, or what he calls an \" eternal merger \" with Kuwait. In a long verbal attack read on Iraqi television Thursday, Saddam repeatedly called Bush \" a liar \" and said a shooting war could produce body bags courtesy of Baghdad. \" We continue to pray and pray hard to God so that there will be no confrontation whereby you will receive thousands of Americans wrapped in sad coffins after you had pushed them into a dark tunnel, \" Saddam said. He called U.S. soldiers massing in Saudi Arabia the real occupiers in the Persian Gulf. Replied State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher, \" We have n't really analyzed the statement in detail but it appears to be just another example of his outlandish rhetoric and his attempts to distort the truth. \" We believe that his words can not distract the world from the facts of Iraqi aggression. \" An international land, sea and air force has mobilized since Iraq 's invasion, which was sparked by disputes over oil, land and repayment of war loans. In the largest U.S. military operation since Vietnam, an estimated 20,000 American GIs have already massed to defend Saudi Arabia. \" We do n't just arrive, \" said four-star Gen. John Dailey, assistant commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps. \" We 're there to stay for a fairly lengthy period. \" Egypt, Syria, Morocco and Bangladesh also committed ground troops, to a much lesser degree. The U.S. Navy has 27 ships in the maritime barricade of Iraq. They are aided by Britain, West Germany, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium. Bush was expected to authorize naval commanders to use \" the minimum force necessary \" to interdict shipments to and from Iraq, a U.S. official said. That could include firing across the bow to halt a ship. In the air, U.S. Air Force fliers say they have engaged in \" a little cat and mouse \" with Iraqi warplanes, which have retreated when weapons radar locks onto them. \" They do n't want to play with us, \" one U.S. crew chief said. In Kuwait, the Iraqis have rimmed the capital city with an air-defense system, according to a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. He declined to say if the weapons included missiles, but the Iraqis have them in their arsenal. The Iraqis also possess chemical weapons. The combined operations are designed to isolate and strangle Iraq until it retreats from Kuwait. The quarantine hopes to staunch the flow of Iraqi oil, which is Iraq 's economic lifeblood, and clamp down on food and supplies going in. Iraq now controls 20 percent of the world 's oil reserves with its conquest of Kuwait. Only Saudi Arabia has more oil reserves. The economic chokehold appears to be working. The Lloyd 's List International newspaper, which monitors worldwide shipping, said Iraq 's fleet of 80 tankers and cargo ships has stopped regular trading. John Prescott, a shipping correspondent, said there was no shipping in Kuwaiti or Iraqi ports and that activity was trailing off in the Jordanian port of Aqaba. Bush 's chief objective in his meeting with Hussein was to press the king to shut down Iraq 's food and oil supply route from Aqaba on the Red Sea. Aqaba is Iraq 's only outlet now that an international noose has tightened. Bush has indicated the U.S. Navy will barricade the port from Iraqi ships. The president also has offered to help offset Jordan 's costs because 40 percent of its exports go to Iraq and 90 percent of its oil comes from there. \" It 's our only outlet to the sea and the rest of the world, \" Hussein said. He also said of trade with Iraq: \" There are no shipments at the moment. \" A day earlier, scores of trucks, many with Iraqi license plates, streamed north out of Aqaba to Amman and onto the desert highway bound for Iraq. The Jordanian monarch met this week with Saddam, but he told reporters he had no message from Baghdad. \" I am not talking on behalf of anyone in the area... but myself, \" Hussein said. In the United Nations, Libya called for the replacement of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf with Arab League forces and U.N. soldiers. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, in a letter to the U.N. Secretary - General, also called for an emergency Security Council meeting in Geneva to remove U.S. forces. There was no decision on a meeting. Thirty-two of the 159 U.N. members had filed compliance reports by Wednesday, and all were honoring the sanctions Iraq. Also Thursday, Saudi Arabia called for an emergency conference of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to discuss how much oil to pump. The minister denied the kingdom had notified notified any of its customers of any cutbacks in oil supply. Reports attributed to the Japanese foreign ministry said Saudi Arabia told U.S., European and Japanese oil companies of a 15-20 percent cutback in its oil supply in September. Meanwhile, Egypt 's official Middle East News Agency said Thursday that Saddam was the target of an assassination attempt, which led to \" large-scale \" arrests, including some close associates of the Iraqi strongman. The agency quoted witnesses as saying tanks and armored cars are patrolling the streets of Baghdad. There was no independent confirmation of the report by the government-run news agency, which did not say when the reported attempt occurred.",

This will add nearly 700 seats a week on the route. Thomson, in India to talk to tourism leaders, said the flights would provide extra support to the growing tourism market.

    "text": "O 'SMACH, Cambodia ( AP ) _ The top commander of a Cambodian resistance force said Thursday he has sent a team to recover the remains of a British mine removal expert kidnapped and presumed killed by Khmer Rouge guerrillas almost two years ago. Gen. Nhek Bunchhay, a loyalist of ousted Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, said in an interview with The Associated Press at his hilltop headquarters that he hopes to recover the remains of Christopher Howes within the next two weeks. Howes had been working for the Britain-based Mines Advisory Group when he was abducted with his Cambodian interpreter Houn Hourth in March 1996. There were many conflicting accounts of his fate. Howes ' team was clearing mines 17 kilometers ( 10 miles ) from Angkor Wat, the fabled 11th century temple that is Cambodia 's main tourist attraction, when it was attacked. In January this year, British police officers who had been searching for Howes concluded he had probably been killed soon after being captured. The Foreign Office said it had informed the family of Howes, 37 years old when he was kidnapped, that he probably died within weeks or months of his capture on March 26, 1996. \" Obviously, it is deeply discouraging for the family after 22 months, but there is no proof of life. But there is no evidence in either direction _ that there is proof of life or death, \" said a Foreign Office spokesman, speaking with customary anonymity. \" We will continue to do everything we can to establish what has happened. \" Thai military officials who monitor Cambodian affairs said privately Thursday that Britain, through its embassies in Thailand and Cambodia, has been pushing hard to resolve the Howes case as the second anniversary of his abduction nears. Nhek Bunchhay, who had been closely involved in the search for Howes before having to flee the Cambodian capital after a coup d ' etat last year, appeared confident he would find Howes ' remains. He said he received information from Khmer Rouge guerrillas on where the body had been buried, and recently ordered 10 of his men from a force of 500 near Khmer Rouge headquarters in Anlong Veng to conduct the search. If and when the remains are found, he said, they would be turned over to the British Embassy, apparently meaning they would be sent across the border into Thailand and onward to Bangkok. Nhek Bunchhay said he now believed Howes had been killed within a week of his capture by a Khmer Rouge faction loyal to Pol Pot, then the guerrilla group 's leader. Pol Pot is considered responsible for the radical policies that led to the deaths of as many as 1.7 million Cambodians when the communist group held power in the late 1970s. At the time Howes was captured, the Khmer Rouge were a more or less united guerrilla force with more than 10,000 men under arms. But the group began to fall apart in mid-1996 after the defection of one of its top leaders, Ieng Sary. Other commanders, and thousands of guerrillas, followed him. A small hardcore group under Pol Pot continued to hold out at their headquarters at Anlong Veng in northern Cambodia near the Thai border. But in June last year, the remaining leadership had a falling out, and Pol Pot was arrested. In July last year in Phnom Penh, Cambodia 's capital, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen staged a successful coup d ' etat against First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh. Ranariddh 's loyalists, including Nhek Bunchhay, his top military commander, went into hiding or fled the capital. Nhek Bunchhay, evading an intensive manhunt, made his way to O 'Smach, the last major outpost held by Ranariddh 's forces. His men have held the stronghold _ which is on the border just opposite the Thai province of Surin _ against repeated intense attacks by Hun Sen 's troops. They have been aided by Khmer Rouge guerrillas from Anlong Veng, who have formed an alliance with Ranariddh 's resistance forces to oppose Hun Sen.",

    "text": "JERUSALEM ( AP ) _ Taking the stand in her own defense, a friend of Yitzhak Rabin 's assassin said Friday that she regretted calling the prime minister a traitor and praying for his death. Margalit Har - Shefi, 22, has pleaded innocent to charges that she failed to report Yigal Amir 's plan to kill Rabin. She took the stand for more than four hours Friday in a Tel Aviv magistrate 's court. Amir, 27, is serving a life sentence for the November 1995 assassination of Rabin at a Tel Aviv peace rally. Newspaper reports have said Amir was infatuated with Har - Shefi and may have been trying to impress her by killing the prime minister. Har - Shefi acknowledged she told police interrogators that Rabin was a traitor and that she prayed for him to have a heart attack and die. She said Rabin 's murder was \" a black stain on Israel, \" Israel radio and Israel army radio reported. Har - Shefi said she heard Amir talk about killing Rabin but did not tell the police because she did not believe he was serious. Instead, she turned to her community rabbi in the Jewish West Bank settlement of Beit El and told him about Amir 's statements. The rabbi said called the talk about killing Rabin \" nonsense, \" and said Jews are prohibited from killing one another, the radio reports said. Har - Shefi described Amir as an \" original thinker, \" as well as delusional and a liar. She also denied accusations made by Amir 's brother, Hagai, that she joined an anti-Arab underground movement. She said she gave the Amir brothers false information regarding the location of a weapons and ammunition cache when they asked her to help organize such a movement.",

    "text": "ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia ( AP ) _ The Organization of African Unity said Friday it would investigate the Hutu-organized genocide of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis in Rwanda nearly four years ago. Foreign ministers of member-states meeting in the Ethiopian capital agreed to set up a seven-member panel to investigate who shot down Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana 's plane on April 6, 1994. The assassination touched off a murderous rampage by Hutu security forces and civilians, who slaughtered mainly Tutsis but also Hutus who favored reconciliation with the minority. It also reignited the civil war. The panel also will look at the exodus of about 2 million Rwanda Hutus to neighboring countries where they lived in U.N.-run refugee camps for 2 1/2 years. The investigation will consider the role of \" internal and external forces prior to the genocide and subsequently, and the role of the United Nations and its agencies and the OAU before, during and after the genocide, \" the OAU said. The panel will be based in Addis Ababa, and will finish its investigation within a year, it said. It is to be funded by voluntary contributions from within and outside the continent. ( aa-kjd )",

    "text": "MOSCOW ( AP ) _ Presidents Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine and Boris Yeltsin of Russia signed an economic cooperation plan Friday, and Yeltsin claimed they resolved even more nagging problems. Russia and Ukraine share similar cultures and languages, and Ukraine was ruled from Moscow for centuries. But while the two Slavic neighbors see themselves as natural partners, their relations since the breakup of the Soviet Union have been bedeviled by a number of disputes _ Black Sea naval bases, border problems and Ukraine 's natural gas debts. \" We have covered the entire list of questions and discussed how we will be tackling them, \" Yeltsin was quoted as saying by the ITAR - Tass news agency. \" I must say there are no unsettled problems any more. We have solved them all. \" But his sweeping statement contained no details, and gave no indication of how the disputes could be resolved. Their solution would require a compromise between the two nations ' parliaments. A major dispute concerns a broad political treaty calling for border demarcation, which the two presidents signed last May. In effect, the treaty amounts to Russian recognition of Ukraine 's sovereignty and borders, and the Ukrainian parliament has already ratified it. However, Russia has stalled ratification, trying to tie it to an agreement that would permit the Russian navy to use a naval base on Ukraine 's Crimean peninsula for at least 20 more years. In their joint statement issued after the talks, Yeltsin and Kuchma called for the fastest possible ratification of the treaty, saying it would create a \" strong legal foundation \" for bilateral ties and help stability in Europe. Kuchma assured Yeltsin that Ukraine would not join NATO, Yeltsin 's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said, according to the Interfax news agency. The Russian leadership has staunchly opposed the western alliance 's expansion into Eastern Europe. In their joint statement, released by the Kremlin, the two leaders also pledged to consult each other regularly on their approaches to relations with NATO and, in particular, their action within the framework of NATO 's Partnership for Peace program. Last year, Russian officials assailed Ukraine for holding joint naval exercises with NATO in the Black Sea _ an area Moscow considers its own turf. Kuchma has said repeatedly that Ukraine would remain neutral for the foreseeable future. Yeltsin and Kuchma also called for developing the stagnant relations between the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a loose coalition of former Soviet republics. In the past, Russia has often claimed that Ukraine was undermining efforts at closer cooperation within the CIS. A major goal of Kuchma 's four-day state visit was the signing of a 10-year economic program aimed at doubling the two nations ' trade turnover, which fell to dlrs 14 billion last year, down dlrs 2.5 billion from 1996. The two presidents on Friday signed the plan, which calls for cooperation in the metallurgy, fuel, energy, aircraft building, missile, space and chemical industries. A major project is joint manufacturing of An-70 cargo planes, the Kremlin statement said. The program also calls for coordination of economic reforms and joint improvement of social programs in the two countries, where many people have become impoverished during the chaotic post-Soviet transition to capitalism. Kuchma also planned to visit Russian gas giant Gazprom, most likely to discuss Ukraine 's dlrs 1.2 billion debt to the company. ( pvs / vi / ji )",

    "text": "JERUSALEM ( AP ) _ Top Israeli officials sent strong new signals Sunday that Israel wants to withdraw from southern Lebanon, where a costly war of attrition has been steadily claiming soldiers ' lives. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his Cabinet on Sunday that Israel was willing to withdraw from southern Lebanon provided Israel 's northern frontier could be secured. \" If the Lebanese government will cooperate with us in making appropriate security arrangements in south Lebanon, we will be happy to get out of Lebanon in the framework of implementation of U.N. Resolution 425, \" Netanyahu told his ministers. That 1978 resolution calls for Israel 's unconditional withdrawal from the self-declared security zone it occupies in south Lebanon, and for the deployment of the Lebanese army and U.N. forces to ensure security along the Lebanese - Israeli border. On Friday, Netanyahu said he had \" no qualms \" about implementing the U.N. resolution, as long as Israel had \" the necessary security safeguards. \" Cabinet minister Michael Eitan said Sunday that Netanyahu 's remarks marked a substantive change in Israel 's position. \" We will defend our north from the international border, \" said Eitan, the science minister. \" No one wants to stay in Lebanon; thus we think it better to withdraw. \" Uri Lubrani, Israel 's top official for Lebanon affairs, also suggested Israel was willing to modify its political goals in Lebanon. \" This is a new thing... it means that we are willing to talk today _ full stop _ about security, \" Lubrani told Israel 's Channel One. \" We have gotten off the issue of peace, off the issue of normalization. \" As the death toll in Lebanon has mounted, the Israeli government has been faced with a growing grassroots movement calling for Israel 's unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon. Since 1985 _ when the Israelis created a security buffer zone southern Lebanon _ nearly 200 Israeli soldiers have been killed fighting Hezbollah and other guerrillas. Last week, Hezbollah fighters killed three Israeli soldiers and seriously wounded six others. The Israelis suffered a record 39 deaths in southern Lebanon last year. In addition, 73 soldiers were killed en route to Lebanon when two military helicopters crashed last February. The Maariv newspaper said Sunday that Netanyahu 's comments last week were in response to signals from Syria that it wants to renew the long-stalled peace talks between the two countries. The newspaper, quoting \" secret reports, \" said Syria had indicated its interest in resuming talks in remarks made last week by the Syrian ambassador to Washington, Walid Mualem, in a lecture to a closed forum in Baltimore. Two top aides to Netanyahu, political adviser Uzi Arad and Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh, left for Europe on Sunday, apparently to investigate the Syrian issue, the newspaper said. Israel - Syrian talks have been cut off for nearly two years. Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai was the first senior Israeli official to refer to U.N. resolution 425 in a speech six weeks ago, saying at the time he was willing to withdraw troops in exchange for guarantees that Israel would not be attacked.",

    "text": "BAGHDAD, Iraq ( AP ) _ An American leader of a U.N. weapons inspection team resumed work in Iraq Friday, nearly two months after his team was effectively blocked. Scott Ritter led his team on a 10-hour tour of three suspected weapons sites classified as \" sensitive \" by the Iraqi authorities, U.N. spokesman Alan Dacey said. \" All sites were inspected to the satisfaction of the inspection team and with full cooperation of Iraqi authorities, \" Dacey said. At least one of the sensitive sites was a barracks of the elite Republican Guard, a well-placed source told The Associated Press. Previously the Iraqis have resisted attempts to inspect such quarters. The U.N. Security Council has charged the inspectors with verifying that Iraq has destroyed its long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction. It was the first time that Ritter, who arrived Thursday with some 50 inspectors for a tour likely to last over a week, had been allowed to carry out an inspection since Jan. 13. Then the Baghdad government stopped providing Ritter 's team with escorts, making it impossible for him to enter any site. Iraq alleged Ritter was an American spy whose team had a disproportionately high number of Americans and Britons. The official Iraqi News Agency, which gives the daily tally of inspections, did not mention Ritter by name, but said Friday that team no. 225 _ which Ritter heads _ made surprise visits to a number of sites and was assisted by aerial surveillance. Five other U.N. inspection teams visited a total of nine other sites, the agency reported. An Iraqi official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, said Ritter would not try to visit any of the eight presidential sites that Baghdad had placed off-limits to U.N. weapons inspectors. The official said these sites could only be visited by a special team of U.N. monitors and diplomats as laid down by the Feb. 23 accord signed by U.N. Secretary - General Kofi Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. Ritter 's return is seen as something of a test of that agreement, under which Iraq agreed to give inspectors full access to eight of Saddam Hussein 's presidential palaces. The United States had moved additional troops and a naval armada into the Gulf and said it would strike Iraq unless it gave the U.N. arms inspectors unfettered access to all potential weapons sites, including Saddam 's palaces. Iraq had argued the presidential sites should be off limits as symbols of sovereignty. A Pentagon spokesman said Thursday that the 38,000 U.S. troops in the Gulf will remain until Iraq complies with the U.N. Security Council agreement over weapons inspections. \" We are going to maintain our forces in the region for the foreseeable future, \" said spokesman Kenneth Bacon. The U.N.-Iraq accord was worked out by U.N. Secretary - General Kofi Annan, who appointed a retired Indian diplomat on Thursday as his special representative to Iraq. Prakash Shah, 58, a former Indian ambassador to the United Nations, is part of an effort by Annan to expand contacts with the Iraqi leadership. Palace inspections are not expected to start until the new agreement 's procedures are in place. U.N. officials in New York on Friday finished drafting the rules, in consultation with Iraqi diplomats. The procedures are due to go before the Security Council next week. The Security Council has said it will not lift the sweeping sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait until the U.N. inspectors certify that Baghdad has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.",

    "text": "BELFAST, Northern Ireland ( AP ) _ Police seized a car bomb under construction Sunday in a town bordering Northern Ireland on the eve of the return to peace talks by the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party. Chief Superintendent Al McHugh said the bomb discovered in the Irish Republic was destined for an unknown target in Northern Ireland and \" would have caused massive destruction. \" The discovery appeared to be the latest attempt by extremists opposed to the IRA 's 8-month-old truce to undermine the peace process, set to resume Monday in Belfast. Extremists have bombed two predominantly pro-British Protestant towns and fired mortar shells at a police station since Sinn Fein was expelled from peace talks on Feb. 20 in punishment for two killings blamed on the Irish Republican Army. Police found more than 1,300 pounds ( 600 kgs ) of fertilizer-based explosives Sunday in a shed in Dundalk, 50 miles ( 80 kms ) south of Belfast. They arrested two men in connection with the bomb factory, which also contained circuitry, detonating cord and the Mitsubishi truck that would have carried the bomb. The British and Irish governments, which cosponsor the multi-party talks that are supposed to conclude by May, invited Sinn Fein to rejoin two weeks ago. But Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams kept his party out pending meetings with British Prime Minister Tony Blair 10 days ago and President Clinton last week. \" We were unjustly pushed out of the talks in February but we are back, \" Adams said Sunday. He said the north 's substantial Catholic minority demanded a settlement that would promote Northern Ireland 's eventual unification with the Irish Republic. \" Nationalists in the north are not a minority in someone else 's country. We are Irish citizens, living in our own country, \" Adams said, adding: \" Nationalists want to move towards Irish unity and see this process as a bridge in that direction. \" But the north 's pro-British Protestant majority is bitterly opposed to uniting Ireland and instead wants a strong government for Northern Ireland, which has been ruled directly by London since 1972. Northern Ireland 's biggest Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, is threatening to push for Sinn Fein 's expulsion once again. They say IRA commanders are responsible for the recent bomb attacks. Also Sunday, more than 2,000 Catholic protesters rallied in Portadown against the annual parades by the Orange Order, Northern Ireland 's dominant Protestant fraternal group. Confrontations among Catholic protesters, Protestant marchers and the police have provoked widespread violence in Northern Ireland for the past three summers. The crucible is Portadown, 30 miles ( 50 kms ) southwest of Belfast, where Orangemen march each July from their rural church back downtown _ through the town 's main Catholic area. Protesters from several Catholic communities crowded into Portadown 's Catholic Garvaghy Road to hear speakers demand negotiations with Orange Order leaders, and pledge to participate in each others ' road-blocking protests this summer. \" Small nationalist communities are not going to be left on their own this summer, \" said Gerard Rice, a former IRA prisoner who leads anti-Orange protests in a Catholic neighborhood of south Belfast. Riot police in armored cars, shields and helmets prevented a few hundred Protestants, many waving British and Ulster flags, from interfering with the Catholics as they marched within Portadown 's few Catholic streets. Earlier Sunday, police and militant Protestants clashed in a religiously polarized part of north Belfast. Police said an unmarked police car was hit with gasoline bombs from the Protestant side. Riot police responded with a volley of plastic bullets that scattered a 50-strong mob. An elderly Catholic man was hospitalized from cuts after a Protestant gasoline bomb landed in his back yard. Police arrested six Protestants on suspicion of rioting. ( sp / eml )",

With the convergence of communications and information technologies ( IT ) coupled with the coming of age for the Internet and its related technologies, the stage is set for Malaysians to seize the chance to transform into a knowledge society and become worthy opponents / players in the global market space. The Internet, the global network of computers, is now far reaching into the country - extending its embrace to include every nook and cranny of the nation - opening doors to not only a diverse range of information sources but also an exhaustive list of possibilities to create new applications which add value to people 's lives. In the business world, the Internet - through intranet and extranet solutions - has become an invaluable tool for companies to harness so as to gain a competitive edge. The solutions are also vital components in developing the borderless marketing flagship application which is a vital element for spearheading the development of the Multimedia Super Corridor ( MSC ) project. The application will create the necessary framework and infrastructure to support electronic commerce ( e-commerce ) initiatives in the country. However, it is important to note that installing or implementing Internet technologies for technology 's sake would not ensure instant success. For e-commerce to flourish with full-blown end-to-end business transactions, strategic planning which incorporates both business and technology plans that are complementary is necessary for an organisation to see feasible returns on investment. Intranets, through the use of Internet technology, are positioned as a platform for companies to optimise, expand and transform new channels of business. When strategically implemented, an intranet solution will provide the ability to mediate mission-critical, decision support functions in organisations. It will also help further improve communications and collaboration at all levels in an organisation. With intranets in place, it is only logical for organisations to respectively link the network to other companies ' for extended business purposes through extranets. While this will enable the sharing of information among enterprises, security issues such as firewalls and encryption as well as access and control procedures, and the trust levels that enterprises have with each other will emerge and there will be a need to address them. Other than usage in business, Internet technology is also beginning to infiltrate the lifestyle domain. \" Smart homes \" have emerged bringing a wealth of information and entertainment to families over telecommunications lines. The art of socialising is also experiencing a change where Net / virtual relationships are fast overtaking or becoming parallel with the normal human relationships. Whether this would prove positive or otherwise towards society in the future is yet to be seen. All in all, the Internet has a lot to offer. However, its value and benefits are only as good as how we use it.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON _ The economy created jobs at a surprisingly robust pace in January, the government reported on Friday, evidence that America 's economic stamina has withstood any disruptions caused so far by the financial tumult in Asia. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said the economy added 358,000 jobs last month, far above the 235,000 forecast by economists. It was the third consecutive month that job generation has been exceptionally strong. With growing opportunities for work drawing more people into the labor force, the unemployment rate remained at 4.7 percent last month, just a notch above its quarter-century low. The demand for workers also led employers to raise wages again last month. Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees rose 4 cents, to $ 12.51. The gain left wages 3.8 percent higher than a year earlier, extending a trend that has given back to workers some of the earning power they lost to inflation in the last decade. But economists said the wage increase was not enough to raise any concerns about higher inflation. And because the Federal Reserve has made clear that it expects the economy to slow in coming months as ripple effects from Asia reach the United States, investors disregarded the large jobs gains, betting that neither a rise in interest rates nor resurgent inflation is looming. Stocks rose, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up 72.24 points, to 8,189.49, leaving the index within 70 points of its record high set on Aug. 6. In the bond market, a sensitive barometer of inflation anxiety, prices edged up, pushing down the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond to 5.92 percent from 5.93 percent. \" Job creation is sturdy and we have effective price stability, \" said Paul McCulley, an economist at UBS Securities. \" The bottom line is that we 've got a lovely economy. \" With potential inflation counterbalanced by worries about possible price declines, the Fed and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, have suggested that they intend to keep interest rates unchanged until the economy tilts clearly in one direction or another. The job figures for January extended a surge in employment gains that began last fall, just when the labor market had showed signs of cooling. After accounting for a small downward revision Friday to December 's figures, the economy has been creating jobs at a rate of 358,000 a month for the last four months _ and 381,000 over the last three months _ after averaging 242,000 for the first nine months of 1997. The surge in jobs reflects a remarkable confluence of positive and self-reinforcing economic forces. Inflation has been almost nonexistent, and consumer confidence has been extremely strong. After a short, sharp drop when Asia 's financial problems first became clear, the stock market has rebounded and corporate profits have remained healthy. Long-term interest rates, an important indicator of economic stability, have fallen in the last few months. Lower rates have helped invigorate housing and other interest-sensitive sectors of the economy by making loans more affordable, and have allowed companies to continue investing heavily in more efficient equipment. The likelihood that the federal budget will soon move from deficit into surplus has further improved the outlook. The less money the government needs to borrow, the more is freed for private investment. President Clinton welcomed the job figures at a news conference Friday. His advisers said the results reflected not just from balancing the budget, but also initiatives like improved access to education and training and the opening of foreign markets to trade. \" There are enormous economic and social benefits from our nation 's high-employment economy, \" said Janet Yellen, the chairwoman of the White House 's Council of Economic Advisers. Some of the biggest employment gains came in the construction industry, which added 92,000 jobs in January. The increase reflected the strength of the housing industry, which has been helped not just by declining interest rates but also by unusually warm weather. Service industries also showed solid job gains, as did manufacturers, two areas expected to be hardest hit when the effects of the Asian crisis hit the American economy. The major harm from Asia is likely to come from the plunge in the value of many Asian currencies relative to the dollar, a situation that is expected to lead to a surge of inexpensive imports into the United States, hurting American competitors. And the weakness of the Asian economies is also likely to lead to decreased demand for American exports. \" The economy has been running on the fumes of the strength from before the Asia shock, \" McCulley said. \" Those fumes will exhaust themselves, and the manufacturing sector is going to start getting beat up in the spring. \" The figures showed the unemployment rate for adult men declined to 3.8 percent last month from 4.1 percent in December, the lowest figure for almost two decades. The rate for adult women rose 0.4 percent, to 4.4 percent. For the first time, the Labor Department broke out unemployment by education level as well as gender, age and race. The analysis showed unemployment rates dropped steadily with higher levels of education. Among people with less than a high school education, the rate in January was 7.2 percent. Among high school graduates, the rate was 3.9 percent, and college graduates, 1.9 percent.",

    "text": "NEWARK, N.J. _ A new Essex County task force began delving Thursday into the slayings of 14 black women over the last five years in the Newark area, as law-enforcement officials acknowledged that they needed to work harder to solve the cases of murdered women. The police and prosecutors said they had identified different suspects in six of the cases and had yet to find any pattern linking the killings or the victims, several of whom were believed to be prostitutes. State, county and local law-enforcement officials have expressed concerns in recent months about a possible pattern of murdered women and a disproportionate number of unsolved cases. Citing an example, Sgt. Derek Glenn, a spokesman for the Newark Police Department, said that of nine women who had been killed last year, suspects had been arrested in only four cases. But over all, arrests were made in more than 60 percent of murder cases, he said. Eight of the 14 killings since 1993 were already under investigation by the Newark Police Department, Glenn said. Of the eight victims, three were stabbed, two were strangled, two were beaten to death and one was asphyxiated, he said, and these different methods of killing and other evidence seem to indicate that the eight cases are not related. But with the task-force investigation just getting under way, officials have been careful not to draw any firm conclusions, leaving open the possibility of a serial killer in some of the cases. There have been no arrests in any of the slayings. \" I have n't seen a pattern yet, \" said Patricia Hurt, the Essex County prosecutor, who created the task force on Tuesday. \" The type of lifestyle these women have is extremely dangerous, \" she said.",

    "text": "The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, April 25: The Supreme Court took a detour this week from the core principle of gender fairness it vindicated two years ago in its ruling invalidating the use of sexual stereotypes to justify denying women admission to the Virginia Military Institute. By a 6-3 vote, the court upheld a discriminatory immigration law that gives a child born overseas to an unmarried American woman a better chance at citizenship than a child born to an unmarried American man. Under the statute, a child born abroad to an unwed American mother is automatically considered a U.S. citizen. But the child of an unwed American father has no citizenship rights unless the father takes the affirmative step of acknowledging paternity and formally agrees to provide support until the child turns 18. The majority 's views were expressed in three separate opinions, the most disquieting of which was written by a liberal member, Justice John Paul Stevens, and joined by a conservative, Chief Justice William Rehnquist. The opinion, which found the gender distinction reasonable, relied heavily on outmoded generalities about family roles, including the flawed presumption that mothers have a closer relationship to their children than fathers do. As Justice Stephen Breyer asked in a strong dissent, \" what sense does it make \" to apply citizenship barriers \" only to fathers and not to mothers in today 's world _ where paternity can readily be proved and where women and men both are likely to earn a living in the workplace? \". Justices Sandra Day O ' Connor and Anthony Kennedy seemed to agree that the law amounted to unconstitutional sex discrimination. Butinstead of providing the votes to strike it down, they chose to uphold it on the flimsy ground that because the sex of the parent and not the child made the difference under the law, the plaintiff did not have standing to bring the case. The Justice Department, which supported the statute, did not cover itself with glory either. The department retreated from its position in the VMI case when it argued that the government could not make policy based on stereotypes \" even when those stereotypes reflect current realities. \" As for the court, it managed with its splintered ruling to cast doubt both on the constitutionality of the immigration provisions it upheld and on its true commitment to fighting gender stereotypes.",

NPR 's Elaine Corey has more from San Francisco. In nineteen ninety-one Charles Keating was convicted in state court of helping to defraud thousands of investors who bought high risk junk bonds sold by Keating 's employees at Lincoln savings and loan. The bonds became worthless when the bankrupt thrift was seized by government regulators. Keating 's convictions were thrown out in nineteen ninety-six on a technicality. And on that basis Keating was released from prison before he was eligible for parole. Now the ninth US circuit court of appeals has ruled that the original appeal was flawed since it brought up issues that had not been raised before. That means the convictions stand, a ruling likely to send Keating 's lawyers back to state court where they must start over with a new appeal. Elaine Corey, NPR news, San Francisco.",

No one was hurt, but firefighters ordered the evacuation of nearby homes and said they 'll monitor the shifting ground. In the northern California town of Rio Nido, officials say a football field sized slab of hillside could still break loose at any time and destroy an entire neighborhood.

Sununu was told Wednesday by Bush 's son, George, that he had alienated members of the Cabinet, the White House staff and the Republican political community, creating a situation that puts his effectiveness in significant doubt, the sources said. The message to the chief of staff was meant to be taken as a suggestion that Sununu offer to resign, one highly placed source said. Instead, Sununu sought to prove to the president that his supporters outnumber his critics and that he should remain in his post. One senior official Monday described the White House as \" a collection of small groups of aides holding their breaths, \" waiting to see whether Sununu survives. One GOP source, reporting on a call from the chief of staff to a Republican leader, said Sununu lamented that \" the noose is tightening around my neck, and I need your help. \"; Another highly placed source said the president 's son met with Sununu last week after holding a series of conversations about the structure of the White House staff and of the campaign with other Bush loyalists and GOP activists. The source said the younger Bush \" sketched out for Sununu \" problems the president is encountering because of the chief of staff 's tenure. \" He was told... the handwriting was on the wall, \" the source said Monday. That, the source said, was when Sununu started calling congressional Republicans and asking them to tell Bush that the conservative wing of the party, in particular, would object if he were fired. Officials said the president himself met with Sununu Sunday. A source said the outcome of that session was unclear.",

    "text": "While the expansion of the Internet has been a blessing for researchers, students and the just plain curious, the new opportunities mentioned by Mr. Gates are also being used by some rather unsavory characters. A new report says there has been a dramatic rise in the growth of hate groups in the United States over the past year. And many of them are using the Internet to spread their messages of racial superiority. VOA 's Jim Teple has details from our southeast news bureau. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights monitoring group based in Montgomery, Alabama, has long monitored such groups as the Ku Klux Klan. More recently it has followed the growth of the militia movement and church groups that preach a message of white supremacy and anti-semitism. The new study written by Mark Potach, who edits the Southern Poverty Law Center 's Intelligence Report, warns that such groups grew rapidly last year, mostly by recruiting younger members. Mr. Potach says the growth is surprising since membership in hate groups usually declines during periods of economic prosperity. We in fact have seen hate group numbers dropping through the nineties, uh but this year they jumped up uh twenty percent, quite a dramatic rise. Mark Potach says over four hundred hate groups have been identified and many are becoming increasingly successful at recruiting younger members through the use of Internet web pages and the promotion of racist rock music. The Internet has certainly helped uh hate mongers to organize and uh to feel that they are part of a larger community, even if uh they are essentially uh, you know, angry people sitting in their bedrooms uh all alone. Uh, in addition, white power racist music has become uh quite popular in certain sectors. Uh, there are over fifty thousand CDs a year sold with uh lyrics that are quite uh unbelievable. Many of these new members are joining chapters of the so called Christian Identity Movement which cites Biblical scripture as a foundation for a belief in white supremacy and anti-semitism. Mark Potach says such members are also intensely attracted to apocalyptical fantasies. The approach of the year two thousand has many of these groups in a kind of millennial frenzy. Uh, uh a - they believe, or at least many of them believe, uh that they are approaching the Battle of Armageddon in which they will be pitted against the uh kind of Satanic forces trying to take over the world. Mr. Potach notes older, more traditional groups like the Ku Klux Klan are also opening new chapters, thanks in part to their ability to use new technologies like the Internet. The Federal Bureau of Investigation says it received more than eight thousand reports of hate group crimes last year. Law enforcement authorities say such reports are likely to increase as police departments are now beginning to more accurately report hate crimes than they have in the past.

    "text": "The US government recently announced new regulations designed to change the way transplant organs are made available to sick patients. Under the new guidelines, donor organs will be made available to the sickest people first, wherever they live in the country. Currently, transplant organs are rationed through a regional system of distribution. The private group that runs the current system, United Network for Organ Sharing, or UNOS, objects to the new regulations. UNOS says the regulations put the federal government in charge of deciding who gets transplants and that many hospital transplant centers would be forced to close. Health and Human Services Secretary Do - Donna Shalala says patients who need an organ transplant should not have to take a chance that an organ will become available in their local area, nor should patients have to travel to transplant centers far from their homes to improve their chances of getting an organ. UNOS spokeswoman Donna Henry Wright says the new policy would not necessarily be more fair or effective because allowances are already made for the most needy patients. The sickest patients are already treated first. There are not huge waiting uh disparit - waiting time disparities amongst the very uh sickest patients. It 's between two to six days for every one uh of the sickest patients across the country. um So it 's a - it 's a fallacy that they 're doing this because um the sickest patients are n't being served. Doctor James Burdick, the Professor of Transplant Surgery at Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, and former President of UNOS, said the current system has evolved over several years and it works well. You may, in a year or two, save a few more lives if you do sickest first. But the number of patients waiting then begins to increase, um and, in fact, um over the years many more patients who are about to die of liver tra - uh without a liver transplant would accumulate. If you do the uh alternative extreme, you do n't save as many lives in the early years, by a small fraction. Our system is balanced, it 's right in the middle. And, therefore, it works very well. Nationwide, there are about ten thousand patients waiting for liver transplants each year and only four thousand organs become available for transplants. Secretary Shalala says UNOS five months ago, or gave them five months to develop a new plan to distribute livers which are in the shortest supply. This is VOA Today.",

    "text": "Iraq 's Saddam Hussein, his options for ending the Persian Gulf crisis growing increasingly unpleasant, assumed the role of embattled Arab hero in offering his first rough proposal for a negotiated end to the confrontation. The Iraqi leader, in an \" initiative \" designed as much to rally Arab public opinion as to launch meaningful negotiations, announced yesterday that he will withdraw his troops from Kuwait only if Israel withdraws from the West Bank and Syria from Lebanon. He apparently hopes to lure support from Arabs who have spurned him so far by suggesting that Iraq will use its occupation of Kuwait as a lever to solve the Arab world 's most frustrating problem, the 23-year Israeli occupation of land claimed by Palestinians. Even as Saddam Hussein was searching for a ploy to ease his isolation, though, the international pressure against him clicked up another notch. The White House yesterday disclosed that Kuwait 's ousted government has formally asked the U.S. to enforce the total trade embargo the United Nations has imposed on Iraq, allowing the U.S. and other nations to immediately begin stopping ships carrying Iraqi goods. Secretary of State James Baker, speaking on ABC News ' \" This Week, \" said the Kuwaiti request gives the U.S. and other countries \" a legal basis for stopping the export of oil and that sort of thing. \" The U.S. maintains that under the U.N. charter, the Kuwaiti request triggers steps for the collective enforcement of international sanctions. Mr. Baker declined to use the word blockade, but said that \" interdiction \" of Iraqi shipments would begin \" almost instantly. \" In a statement, the White House said it would do \" whatever is necessary \" to ensure compliance with the sanctions. Other Bush administration officials said that the international naval force in the area -- consisting of American, British, French, Canadian, Soviet, German and Australian ships -- may be used both to stop oil exports from leaving Iraq and Kuwait and to stop shipments of food and other goods from going in. President Bush implied as much yesterday when reporters asked whether the interdiction would apply to food. The president responded, \" Everything, everything. \" While shying away from actually using the word \" blockade, \" Mr. Bush acknowledged that the U.S. and others were trying to block shipping to Iraq. \" No point getting into all these semantics, \" he said. \" The main thing is to stop the oil from coming out of there. \" The naval interdiction force is part of an overall American strategy that officials say is designed to leave the Iraqi leader with only the stark choice of backing out of Kuwait or launching new attacks to change his situation. Though they insist they are n't trying to lure Saddam Hussein into an attack, officials hope that if he strikes again, the U.S. and its allies will have such an impressive force in place in Saudi Arabia that they will be able to crush him in retaliation. Iraq 's first option, of course, may be simply to sit tight and hope it can endure a trade embargo longer than the West can live without Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. Speaking on the ABC program, Abdul Amir al-Anbari, Iraq 's ambassador to the U.N., asserted that an embargo on Iraq could plunge the U.S. into a \" depression \" and the rest of the world into an economic \" crisis. \" Iraq clearly is trying to woo back more Arab support in case the conflict drags on, hoping that its neighbors eventually will help it survive a prolonged war of economic attrition with the West. So Saddam Hussein on Friday tried to scare other Arab leaders into supporting him by calling on Arabs to rise up in a holy war against leaders who invited American and other Western soldiers into Saudi Arabia to protect the oil-rich kingdom. Then yesterday, he tried to entice Arab leaders with his proposal for a diplomatic solution linking his occupation of Kuwait with Israel 's occupation of the West Bank. The proposal also called for replacing American and other Western troops in Saudi Arabia with Arab forces. The Bush administration immediately said it \" categorically \" rejects the proposals. And President Bush yesterday, asked whether he was at least glad Iraq is discussing negotiations, replied: \" I do n't see anything to be pleasing in there at all. \" American strategists are calculating, though, that the trade sanctions -- enforced by an effective though perhaps undeclared naval blockade -- will hold tightly enough to convince Iraq that it will lose in the long run by simply standing pat. At that point, rather than go through the humiliation of backing out of Kuwait, the Iraqis might well conclude that they need to lash out in some way to shake things up. In that event, Saddam Hussein appears to have three choices. The first would be to launch the much-feared direct invasion of Saudi Arabia, hoping to seize some Saudi oil fields and improve his bargaining position. But that option is growing less and less likely as thousands of American, British, Egyptian, Syrian and Moroccan forces assemble in and around Saudi Arabia to protect the kingdom. The Saudis even have in their possession 48 Kuwaiti jet fighters, virtually the entire Kuwaiti air force, which managed to escape the Iraqi invasion, Saudi officials said. The Saudi \" window of vulnerability... is closing very fast, \" Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to Washington, said over the weekend. The second possibility would be to start a fight with Israel, in hopes that all Arabs would have to move behind Iraq in a fight against their common Israeli enemy. In such an event, Saddam Hussein also might calculate, the Saudis would be under pressure to kick out U.S. troops because of America 's close ties with Israel. Iraq could start hostilities with Israel either through a direct attack or by attacking Jordan. Israel has publicly declared that it will respond to an Iraqi attack on Jordan because it wo n't allow Iraq 's dangerous army to take control of Jordan 's long border with Israel. Iraq 's third attack option would be to start an undeclared war on the U.S. and other Western nations through terrorism. Two Middle East terrorists with records of successful attacks against Western targets, Abu Nidal and Abu Abbas, have ties to Baghdad. And even terrorist groups that opposed Iraq in its war with Iran show signs of swinging behind Saddam Hussein now that he is in a confrontation with the U.S. And Iraq still has thousands of Americans and other Westerners under its control in Iraq and Kuwait. They are n't being allowed to leave and could become hostages. If Iraq chooses a simple war of nerves and economic attrition, the Bush administration knows a long stalemate could try the patience of the American public and the West in general, and could open the possibility that moderate Arabs -- even including Saudi Arabia -- might drop out of the effort against Iraq and accept some deal from Saddam Hussein. But U.S. officials have sized up Saddam Hussein as a man who, despite some recklessness, will back down if he must. \" This is a guy who is impulsive, and therefore capable of big miscalculations, \" says one senior administration official involved in managing the crisis. The official adds, though, that \" at the same time, we think he is someone who is capable of rational judgments when it comes to power. And when he finds something is unprofitable, then one can see certain accommodations. \" Thus, administration aides will be trying to calculate whether Saddam Hussein 's proposed diplomatic formula for getting out of Kuwait represents the first sign he is searching for a way out or simply is a public relations stunt. There are disagreements among experts about how much pressure will be needed to make Saddam Hussein decide he 's up against the wall and whether simple economic pressure will ever be enough. The biggest worry is that if he decides he needs a way out of his predicament but does n't see a face-saving method, he could lash out in dangerous and unpredictable ways. U.S. officials claim they already see signs Saddam Hussein is getting nervous. In the first days after President Bush announced the dispatching of U.S. troops, they note, the Iraqi leader made several nationwide addresses indirectly -- having them read by a television announcer. \" That shows he 's nervous about pinpointing his location, either because he 's afraid we 'll find him, or that internal enemies will, \" says one U.S. official. The unpredictability of Iraq 's leader is a principal reason the U.S. is going to such great lengths to build a mammoth force in and around Saudi Arabia. Pentagon officials say the goal is to put 40,000 troops in the region by the end of the month. But the administration is n't putting any upper limit on how high the force could go after that, calculating that it would be a mistake to underestimate and an advantage to keep Saddam Hussein guessing. U.S. commanders in charge of planning for Middle East crises have indicated in the past that they were capable of deploying as many as 300,000 troops. And the U.S. is taking similar steps to ensure that its naval force is adequate to carry out a blockade of Iraq and support a war if necessary. Over the weekend, Pentagon officials confirmed reports that a fourth U.S. aircraft carrier -- the John F. Kennedy -- and its powerful group of support ships could head for the Middle East within a few days. Three other carriers and their escort vessels already are stationed within striking distance of Iraq or are steaming toward the area. But unless the military situation changes drastically, military officials say, the most likely plan will be for the Kennedy to eventually replace the carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower, which has been on patrol since March and was scheduled to return to port before hostilities erupted in Kuwait. -- Andy Pasztor contributed to this article.",

    "text": "\" So far, the offensive is progressing with dramatic success, \" said a buoyant Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. forces. Similarly, while cautioning about the uncertainty of early battle reports, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said late yesterday that \" the operation has been very successful. \" Amid reports that thousands of Iraqi soldiers had surrendered, administration aides were also upbeat in private, with one even talking of victory within a week. But even continued military success carries political and diplomatic risks for President Bush and the U.S. The allied rejection of the last-minute Soviet-led diplomatic effort to avoid the ground war enabled Mr. Bush to seize the initiative from an Iraq seemingly bent on dictating peace terms. But it has offended some, especially in Arab countries, who now believe that Mr. Bush 's real objectives are the demise of Saddam Hussein and the destruction of the Iraqi military, not just the liberation of Kuwait. \" Why have a war? \" asked Abdul Latif Shekar, a customs officer in Egypt, a country participating in the attack on Iraqi troops. \" I think the Gorbachev plan was a good one. Iraq was ready to withdraw. \" Now, he says, \" it looks like the West just wants to destroy Iraq. \" Despite the early indications of success, the allied forces could still suffer greater casualties and become bogged down militarily, especially when they encounter the tough Republican Guard, which is entrenched along the Iraq - Kuwait border. If so, and if it appears that the American goal actually is to destroy the Iraqi regime even at the cost of badly hurting Iraqi society, \" the lingering cost of that could be high, \" worries former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. But, he notes, \" If everything crumbles totally, that wo n't be such a problem. \" American officials staunchly disavow any interest in driving through Iraq toward Baghdad, either in pursuit of Saddam Hussein himself or to set up some American-controlled government inside Iraq. The Americans say their battle plans call for operating against forces inside Iraq as far north as the city of Basra, about 30 miles north of Kuwait, but say there is n't any plan to drive beyond that. Indeed, French President Francois Mitterrand said yesterday that some allied forces are crossing Iraqi territory as part of a \" pincer \" movement to trap the soldiers occupying Kuwait, but insisted, \" The purpose is n't to invade Iraqi territory, that 's not the aim, that is n't the mandate. \" Nevertheless, American officials over the weekend became more open in declaring that by destroying Saddam Hussein 's military machine they hope to destroy his regime -- a goal likely to be supported by most Americans. In a pre-attack message, Lt. Gen. Walter Boomer, the top Marine in the Persian Gulf, told U.S. Marines that their goal is to \" restore { Kuwait } to its citizens. \" He went on to add that \" in so doing you not only return a nation to its people, but you will destroy the war machine of a ruthless dictator. \" Secretary of State James Baker said on ABC - TV 's \" This Week With David Brinkley \" that the series of United Nations resolutions condemning Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait \" imply that the restoration of peace and stability in the Gulf would be a heck of a lot easier if he and that leadership were not in power in Iraq. \" Of course, it is still far too early to assume that the military situation on the ground will stay as smooth for allied forces as it appears to have been so far. Iraq still has the potential to cause significant problems by using forces and weapons that do n't yet seem fully engaged. For one thing, Iraq still apparently has n't unleashed its stockpile of chemical weapons. Gen. Schwarzkopf said that some early reports that chemical weapons were used against allied troops turned out to be \" bogus. \" Iraq is believed to have the ability to deliver chemical weapons in artillery shells or, perhaps, atop Soviet-made Frog7 missiles. Perhaps more important, it appears that allied troops have n't yet fully engaged Iraq 's vaunted Republican Guard, which has been sitting just north of the Iraq - Kuwait border and is considered the most potent element in the Iraqi defense. It remains to be seen how much damage the allied air campaign was able to inflict on the Guard, and whether President Hussein will commit his most valued troops to a fight-to-the-death finish. Certainly Saddam Hussein continues to implore his country to fight on. \" Fight them, \" he urged Iraqis in a radio address. \" All Iraqis, fight them with all the power you have, and all struggle for everything. \" American war planners have long assumed that the early stage of the ground attack, in which American forces would use their speed to sweep around Iraqi defenses and their strength to punch through the relatively weak Iraqi front line, would be the easiest part. Despite these early successes, the mere fact that a ground campaign has begun almost guarantees that the Bush administration will face fresh problems growing out of the military situation. There are likely to be additional American prisoners of war taken, and there are signs that President Hussein is taking Kuwaiti hostages. U.S. and Kuwaiti officials say there are reports that large numbers of civilians from Kuwait City are being rounded up and held by Iraqi troops, apparently either for use as human shields or for use later in bargaining once the war is over. President Bush 's political argument for going to a ground war has been strengthened by the growing stream of reports of wanton Iraqi destruction inside Kuwait. U.S. officials say that hundreds of Kuwaiti oil wells now may have been set afire. And Robert Gates, Mr. Bush 's deputy national security adviser, asserted in an interview on the Cable News Network that Iraqi troops have set fire to \" large sections \" of Kuwait City. Mr. Bush and his aides were leaning toward a military conclusion of the crisis even before the latest reports of Iraqi atrocities in Kuwait came to light. The president and his top aides tentatively decided on Feb. 11 that a ground war would be necessary. The decision was made after Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, returned from a visit with military commanders in Saudi Arabia, administration officials say. Then, a week or so ago, Gen. Schwarzkopf secretly picked Saturday night as the optimal time to start the offensive. The date was unaffected by the last-ditch Soviet peace initiative. The real problem with the Soviet proposals, U.S. officials now say, was that they all would have required lifting economic sanctions against Iraq. The Bush administration considers the sanctions essential to keeping Saddam Hussein under control should he survive the war. Mr. Bush forestalled further diplomatic maneuvering by issuing an ultimatum on behalf of the allies demanding that Iraq withdraw within a week, starting at noon Saturday. Administration aides said that the idea of the ultimatum was Gen. Powell 's. He argued setting an explicit deadline for Saddam Hussein to break would, when it was broken, give the U.S. military a clear green light to proceed. In setting out his final challenge to Saddam Hussein, Mr. Bush continued the intensive personal diplomacy he began after the invasion last August. After cabling world leaders about his intention to give Saddam Hussein a final deadline to exit Kuwait, he offered him a week to withdraw fully, instead of the four days he originally considered, because of objections from some European partners that four days seemed punitive and unrealistic. And when he and President Gorbachev spoke about the decision in a talk lasting nearly an hour, the President took pains to listen to what his counterpart had to say, although he already had decided that the Soviet alternative to the allied deadline was unacceptable. Finally, when Iraq failed to respond to the U.S. ultimatum, Mr. Bush let the ground offensive begin as previously planned Saturday night. The attack was lightning quick, as allied forces punched through tall sand berms on the border and pushed forward into Iraq and Kuwait. U.S. Marines were said to have breached troublesome mine fields along the Iraqi lines but Pentagon officials said no amphibious assault on Kuwait 's beaches had begun. Long columns of Iraqi prisoners of war could be seen trudging through the desert toward the allied rear. U.S. commanders said 5,500 Iraqi prisoners were taken in the first hours of the ground war, though some military officials later said the total may have climbed above 8,000. The U.S. hopes its troops will drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait quickly, leaving much of Iraq 's offensive military equipment destroyed or abandoned in Kuwait. It expects that tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers will surrender to the U.S. and its allies over the next few days. If the allies succeed, Saddam Hussein will have plunged his country first into a fruitless eight-year war against Iran and then into a humiliating war against the U.S. and the allies to defend his conquest of Kuwait, leaving much of his country 's military establishment and modern infrastructure in ruins. Meanwhile, the U.S. hopes, economic sanctions and an international arms embargo will remain in effect until Iraq pays war reparations to Kuwait to cover war damages. That would undermine any chances of rebuilding either Iraq or its armed forces in short order as long as Saddam Hussein remains in power. The American hope is that someone from within Iraq, perhaps from the army 's professional ranks, will step forward and push Saddam Hussein aside so that the country can begin recovering from the disaster. Outside analysts think Saddam Hussein 's position is indeed precarious. \" I think frankly Saddam is finished, no matter what happens, \" says Christine Helms, a Middle East scholar who has written extensively about Iraq. \" These guys simply do n't retire to condos over the Euphrates. \" Despite the lack of any obvious successors, the Iraqi leader 's internal power base appeared to be narrowing even before the war began. Some analysts say he appeared to be relying on a smaller and smaller circle of close advisers and relatives. If that 's true, the narrowing of his support would make it easier for someone to push him aside from within. Yet, paradoxically, the perception that the U.S. wants to destroy Iraq may increase Saddam Hussein 's support within the Iraqi military. And the U.S. now will face sharper questions in the Arab world since it did n't back the peace proposals worked out in Moscow. \" We looked to the United States, we expected you to have the moral edge, \" says Nasser Tahboub, a Jerusalem-born Jordanian who has an American wife and a doctorate in political science from Duke University. \" Now we see that edge eroded. For me, it is a great tragedy. For the first time in history, the U.S. has gone to war with an Arab and Muslim nation, and we know a peaceful solution was in reach. \" -- Geraldine Brooks in Amman, Jordan, and Craig Forman in Cairo, Egypt, contributed to this article.",

We are here because what happens on this island will also have an impact on the United States. Everything that happens in Cuba gets America 's attention. Incidentally, we just show up to do the broadcast, and Cubans want to know what we 're going to tell Americans, in many cases, what their relatives in the United States are going to hear. Well, this is the eve of the Pope 's visit to one of the last bastions of Communism anywhere in the world, and it is already causing enormous expectations. In Revolution Square, they put up a giant cross today. And right across from the Cuban revolutionary icon Che Guevara, they now have a giant portrait of Jesus. Above it in Spanish, Jesus, in you we believe. Not all Cubans believe, but Castro has invited everyone to welcome the man who has been one of Communism 's most effective adversaries, and that 's why there is suspense. Everyone appears to believe that somehow Cuba is going to change. Castro has said officially that it 's okay to be enthusiastic. And so, people are increasingly enthusiastic by today, Cuban television, which clings to the Communist Party line, actually began to promote its papal coverage. Today, hundreds of people from the US began to arrive, including some Cuban Americans who left here when Castro came to power and are returning to Havana for the first time. The Pope 's visit is important, but they are also coming home. This is quite an extraordinary story unfolding here. We 'll come back to Havana later in the broadcast. But now we 're going to go back to New York, where Diane Sawyer has the rest of the news. Diane?",

The action came in response to a petition filed by Timex Inc. for changes in the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences for imports from developing nations. Previously, watch imports were denied such duty-free treatment. Timex had requested duty-free treatment for many types of watches, covered by 58 different U.S. tariff classifications. The White House said Mr. Bush decided to grant duty-free status for 18 categories, but turned down such treatment for other types of watches \" because of the potential for material injury to watch producers located in the U.S. and the Virgin Islands. \" Timex is a major U.S. producer and seller of watches, including low-priced battery-operated watches assembled in the Philippines and other developing nations covered by the U.S. tariff preferences.

Under the plan, unsecured creditors, who are owed about $ 430 million, would receive about $ 92 million, or 21 cents for each dollar they are owed. In addition, they will receive stock in the reorganized company, which will be named Ranger Industries Inc. After these payments, about $ 225,000 will be available for the 20 million common shares outstanding. The Avon, Conn., company 's stock hit a high in 1983 after it unveiled its Adam home computer, but the product was plagued with glitches and the company 's fortunes plunged. But Coleco bounced back with the introduction of the Cabbage Patch dolls, whose sales hit $ 600 million in 1985. But as the craze died, Coleco failed to come up with another winner and filed for bankruptcy-law protection in July 1988. The plan was filed jointly with unsecured creditors in federal bankruptcy court in New York and must be approved by the court.",

A spokeswoman for Crum amp Forster said employees were told early this week that numerous staff functions for the personal insurance lines were going to be centralized as a cost-cutting move. She said the move would result in a after-tax charge of less than $ 4 million to be spread over the next three quarters. By comparison, for the first nine months, Xerox earned $ 492 million, or $ 4.55 a share, on revenue of $ 12.97 billion. Earnings at Xerox 's financial-services operations actually rose slightly, but that was largely because capital gains at Crum amp Forster offset Hurricane Hugo payments and the reserves set up to cover future payments.

Upjohn officials said they could n't estimate the size of the charge until they determine which employees, and how many, will participate in the retirement plan. But the pharmaceutical company said it \" anticipates the long-term savings resulting from the plan 's implementation will more than offset short-term costs. \" The program, available to Upjohn employees 55 years old or older, could increase an individual 's retirement benefits 10 % to 20 %. In addition, Upjohn is offering a one-time retirement bonus equal to six months of base pay. Chairman Theodore Cooper called the program part of the company 's two-year strategy to implement budget constraints and \" an effective headcount-control program. \" But some analysts questioned how much of an impact the retirement package will have, because few jobs will end up being eliminated. \" It 's a cosmetic move, \" said Jonathan S. Gelles of Wertheim Schroder amp Co. According to Upjohn 's estimates, only 50 % to 60 % of the 1,100 eligible employees will take advantage of the plan. Upjohn further estimated that about 50 % of the employees who leave for early retirement may be replaced. As a result, Upjohn will likely trim only about 275 to 350 of its more than 21,000 jobs world-wide. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Upjohn shares rose 87.5 cents to $ 38.875 apiece. An Upjohn spokesman said he had \" heard nothing \" to suggest the early retirement package was spurred by shareholder pressure or a potential bidder for the company, which occasionally has been the target of takeover speculation. The company earlier this year adopted a shareholder-rights plan to ward off unwanted suitors. The spokesman said it is the first early retirement plan offered under its two-year cost-control strategy. Earlier staff-reduction moves have trimmed about 300 jobs, the spokesman said.",

The St. Louis company earned $ 45.2 million, or 65 cents a share, compared with $ 84.9 million, or $ 1.24 a share, a year earlier. Sales in the latest period were $ 1.76 billion, a 13 % increase from last year 's $ 1.55 billion. For the year ended Sept. 30, Ralston earned $ 422.5 million, or $ 6.44 a share, up 8.9 % from $ 387.8 million, or $ 5.63 a share. This year 's results included a gain of $ 70.2 million on the disposal of seafood operations. Sales for the full year were $ 6.6 billion, up 13 % from $ 5.8 billion. Ralston said its restructuring costs include the phase-out of a battery facility in Greenville, N.C., the recent closing of a Hostess cake bakery in Cincinnati and a reduction in staff throughout the company. The battery plant, which makes rechargeable nickel cadmium and carbon zinc products, will be closed over the next year or so, a spokesman said. Ralston attributed its fourth-quarter slump partly to higher costs of ingredients in the pet food business as well as competitive pressures, which required higher advertising spending. For the year, pet food volume was flat, the company said. Its cereal division realized higher operating profit on volume increases, but also spent more on promotion. The Continental Baking business benefited from higher margins on bread and on increased cake sales, it added. Ralston said its Eveready battery unit was hurt by continuing economic problems in South America. Ralston shares closed yesterday at $ 80.50, off $ 1, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.",

The consumer-products and newsprint company said net rose to $ 108.8 million, or $ 1.35 a share, from $ 90.5 million, or $ 1.12 a share, a year ago. Sales rose 6.2 % to $ 1.45 billion from $ 1.37 billion. After a flat second quarter tied largely to lower newsprint earnings, Kimberly - Clark attributed the gain to improved results in its consumer businesses in North America, Brazil and Korea. Those gains came from higher prices, particularly for disposable diapers and tissue products, and from increased sales, primarily for feminine-care products, the company said. Newsprint results continued to be depressed, the company added, because of industrywide price discounting. The quarter-to-quarter comparison was also enhanced by charges taken in the year-earlier period, including $ 11 million related to the modernization of a pulp and newsprint mill in Alabama. In the 1989 period also, interest expense and tax rates were lower than a year ago. In the first nine months, profit rose 10 % to $ 313.2 million, or $ 3.89 a share, from $ 283.9 million, or $ 3.53 a share. Sales rose 6.7 % to $ 4.27 billion from $ 4 billion.

The British chemical and textile company 's plan, which requires shareholder approval, would create a new, listed U.K. stock with a probable market capitalization between # 300 million ( $ 473 million ) and # 400 million, analysts said. The establishment of the separate company, to be called Courtaulds Textiles, could be effective as early as next year 's first quarter. Investors welcomed the move. Courtaulds ' shares rose 15 pence to 362 pence, valuing the entire company at about # 1.44 billion. Courtaulds ' spinoff reflects pressure on British industry to boost share prices beyond the reach of corporate raiders. Courtaulds ' restructuring is among the largest thus far in Britain, though it is dwarfed by B.A.T Industries PLC 's plans to spin roughly off # 4 billion in assets to help fend off a takeover bid from Anglo - French financier Sir James Goldsmith. The divested Courtaulds textile operations had operating profit of # 50 million on # 980 million in revenue in the year ended March 31. Some analysts have said Courtaulds ' moves could boost the company 's value by 5 % to 10 %, because the two entities separately will carry a higher price earnings multiple than they did combined. In addition, Courtaulds said the moves are logical because they will allow both the chemicals and textile businesses to focus more closely on core activities. Courtaulds has been under pressure to enhance shareholder value since takeover speculators -- including Australian financier Kerry Packer -- surfaced holding small stakes last year. Though Mr. Packer has since sold his stake, Courtaulds is moving to keep its institutional shareholders happy. Even without a specific takeover threat, Courtaulds is giving shareholders \" choice and value, \" said Julia Blake, an analyst at London stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd. In a statement, the company said: \" Both parts can only realize their full potential and be appropriately valued by the market if they are separately quoted companies. The sharper definition and the autonomy which each will thereby gain will benefit shareholders, customers and employees. \" Courtaulds Chairman and Chief Executive Sir Christopher Hogg will remain in both posts at the surviving chemical company after the spinoff.",

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Crossland closed at $ 5.25, down $ 1.875, a 26 % decline. A spokesman said the savings bank may not qualify for the capital requirements because, under the proposed guidelines, its $ 380 million of preferred stock does n't meet the \" core capital \" criteria outlined under the new Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989. He added that final guidelines to be published in early November will determine whether the bank is in compliance. Crossland said it retained three investment bankers to assist it in developing and implementing a financial restructuring plan. It would n't identify the bankers. Additionally, Crossland reported a third-quarter loss of $ 175.5 million, or $ 13.44 a share, compared with net income of $ 27.1 million, or $ 1.16 a share, a year ago. A major factor in the third-quarter loss was the write-down of $ 143.6 million of goodwill. The spokesman said that the proposed guidelines caused Crossland to revise its business objectives and, consequently, to write down the asset value of some previous acquisitions. Crossland recorded an additional $ 20 million in loan loss reserves in the third quarter. Net interest income for the third quarter declined to $ 35.6 million from $ 70.1 million a year ago. However, non-interest income rose to $ 23.5 million from $ 22 million. Third-quarter loan originations dropped sharply to $ 663 million from $ 1 billion a year ago. Standard amp Poor 's Corp. lowered the rating on Crossland 's preferred stock to double-C from single-B-minus and placed it on CreditWatch for possible further downgrade. It also placed on CreditWatch for possible downgrade other securities, including the double-B-minus / B rating of Crossland 's certificates of deposit and the single-B rating of its senior subordinated capital notes.

Institut Merieux S.A., which offered 942 million Canadian dollars ( US $ 801.2 million ), or C $ 37 a share for Connaught, said it would extend its bid, due to expire last Thursday, to Nov. 6. A C $ 30-a-share bid by Ciba - Geigy Ltd., a pharmaceutical company based in Basel, Switzerland, and California-based Chiron Corp., a bioresearch concern, was extended to Nov. 16. It had been due to expire Friday evening. Merieux previously said it would ensure its bid remained open pending a final decision by Canadian regulators on whether to approve the takeover. Merieux, a vaccine and bioresearch firm based in Lyon, France, is controlled 50.1 % by state-owned Rhone Poulenc S.A. The Canadian government previously said Merieux 's bid did n't offer enough \" net benefit \" to Canada to be approved, and gave Merieux an until mid-November to submit additional information. Merieux officials said last week that they are \" highly confident \" the offer will be approved once it submits details of its proposed investments to federal regulators. Both offers are conditional on regulatory approvals and enough shares being tendered to give the bidders a majority of Connaught 's shares outstanding. Institut Merieux, which already holds a 12.5 % stake in Connaught, said that at the close of business Thursday, 5,745,188 shares of Connaught and C $ 44.3 million face amount of debentures, convertible into 1,826,596 common shares, had been tendered to its offer. At the close of business Thursday, Ciba - Geigy and Chiron said 11,580 common shares had been tendered to their offer. At last report, Connaught had 21.8 million shares outstanding. Separately, the Ontario Supreme Court said it will postpone indefinitely a ruling on the lawsuit launched by the University of Toronto against Connaught in connection with the Merieux bid. In a statement prepared by lawyers for the university and Connaught, the parties said they agreed that as a result of reaching a C415 million research accord, \" It is unnecessary that there be a judgment on the merits { of the case } at this time. \" Lawyers for the two sides were n't immediately available for comment. The university had sought an injunction blocking Connaught 's board from recommending or supporting an offer for the company by Merieux.",

The offer, which Telerate 's two independent directors have rejected as inadequate, previously had been scheduled to expire at midnight Friday. Dow Jones said it extended the offer to allow shareholders time to review a supplement to the Dow Jones tender offer circular that it mailed last Friday. The supplement contains various information that has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission since Dow Jones launched the offer on Sept. 26, but it does n't change the terms and conditions of the offer except to extend its expiration date. In Delaware Chancery Court litigation, Telerate has criticized Dow Jones for not disclosing that Telerate 's management expects the company 's revenue to increase by 20 % annually, while Dow Jones based its projections of Telerate 's performance on a 12 % revenue growth forecast. In the tender offer supplement, Dow Jones discloses the different growth forecasts but says it views the 20 % growth rate \" as a hoped-for goal \" of Telerate 's management \" and not as a realistic basis on which to project the company 's likely future performance. \" Telerate shares fell 50 cents on Friday to close at $ 20 each in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Dow Jones shares also fell 50 cents to close at $ 36.125 in Big Board composite trading. Dow Jones has said it believes the $ 18-a-share price is fair to Telerate 's minority shareholders. Late last week, representatives of Dow Jones and Telerate began negotiations about the terms of the offer, but those talks did n't result in any changes in the offer. Telerate provides information about financial markets through an electronic network. Dow Jones, which owns 67 % of Telerate, publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barron 's magazine, community newspapers and operates financial news services and computer data bases.",

    "text": "RJR Nabisco Inc. said it agreed to sell its Baby Ruth, Butterfinger and Pearson candy businesses to Nestle S.A.'s Nestle Foods unit for $ 370 million. The sale, at a higher price than some analysts had expected, helps the food and tobacco giant raise funds to pay debt and boosts Nestle 's 7 % share of the U.S. candy market to about 12 %. The candy businesses had sales of about $ 154 million last year, which was roughly 12 % of total revenue for RJR 's Planters LifeSavers unit, according to a memorandum distributed by RJR 's owner, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts amp Co., to bankers last December. The Nestle acquisition includes a candy plant in Franklin Park, Ill., which employs about 800 workers. The sale, which had been expected, is part of KKR 's program to pay down $ 5 billion of a $ 6 billion bridge loan by February. Roughly $ 2 billion of that debt has already been repaid from previous asset sales, and RJR expects to use another $ 2 billion from the pending, two-part sale of most of its Del Monte unit. That sale, however, could still fall through if financing problems develop. Thus, it remains crucial for RJR to obtain top dollar for its smaller assets like the candy brands. Louis Gerstner Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of New York-based RJR, called the sale a \" significant step \" in the company 's divestiture program, as well as a \" a strategic divestiture. \" Since KKR bought RJR in February for $ 25 billion of debt, it has agreed to sell nearly $ 5 billion of RJR assets. RJR 's executives have said they will dispense with certain brands, in particular, that are n't leaders in their markets. \" RJR Nabisco and Planters LifeSavers will concentrate more on our own core businesses, \" Mr. Gerstner said Friday. Baby Ruth and Butterfinger are both among the top-selling 15 chocolate bars in the U.S., but RJR 's overall share of the roughly $ 5.1 billion market is less than 5 %. Nestle 's share of 7 % before Friday 's purchases is far below the shares of market leaders Hershey Foods Corp. and Mars Inc., which have about 40 % and 36 % of the market, respectively. \" This means Nestle is now in the candybar business in a big way, \" said Lisbeth Echeandia, publisher of Orlando, Fla. -based Confectioner Magazine. \" For them, it makes all kinds of sense. They 've been given a mandate from Switzerland \" to expand their U.S. chocolate operations. Nestle S.A. is based in Vevey, Switzerland. The new candy bars, \" make an important contribution to our Nestle Foods commitment to this very important strategic unit, \" said C. Alan MacDonald, president of Nestle Foods in Purchase, N.Y.",

    "text": "Aetna Life amp Casualty Co.'s third-quarter net income fell 22 % to $ 182.6 million, or $ 1.63 a share, reflecting the damages from Hurricane Hugo and lower results for some of the company 's major divisions. Catastrophe losses reduced Aetna 's net income by $ 50 million, including $ 36 million from Hugo. Last year catastrophe losses totaled $ 5 million, when net was $ 235.5 million, or $ 2.07 a share. The year-earlier results have been restated to reflect an accounting change. The insurer has started processing claims from the Northern California earthquake nearly two weeks ago. But because these claims are more difficult to evaluate and have been coming in more slowly, the company has no estimate of the impact of the earthquake on fourth-quarter results. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Aetna closed at $ 60, down 50 cents. In the latest quarter, Aetna had a $ 23 million loss on its auto / homeowners line, compared with earnings of $ 33 million last year. Profit for its commercial insurance division fell 30 % to $ 59 million, reflecting higher catastrophe losses and the price war in the property / casualty market for nearly three years. However, Aetna 's employee benefits division, which includes its group health insurance operations, posted a 34 % profit gain to $ 106 million. Third-quarter results included net realized capital gains of $ 48 million, which included $ 27 million from the sale of Federated Investors in August and a $ 15 million tax credit.

    "text": "Unisys Corp.'s announcement Friday of a $ 648.2 million loss for the third quarter showed that the company is moving even faster than expected to take write-offs on its various problems and prepare for a turnaround next year. At the same time, the sheer size of the loss, coupled with a slowing of orders, made some securities analysts wonder just how strong that turnaround will be at the computer maker and defense-electronics concern. \" Unisys is getting clobbered. Just clobbered, \" said Ulric Weil, an analyst at Weil amp Associates who had once been high on the company. \" The quarter was terrible, and the future looks anything but encouraging. \" Unisys, whose revenue inched up 3.7 % in the quarter to $ 2.35 billion from $ 2.27 billion in the year-earlier quarter, had an operating loss of about $ 30 million. On top of that, the Blue Bell, Pa., concern took a $ 230 million charge related to the layoffs of 8,000 employees. That is at the high end of the range of 7,000 to 8,000 employees that Unisys said a month ago would be laid off. Unisys said that should help it save $ 500 million a year in costs, again at the high end of the previously reported range of $ 400 million to $ 500 million. The company also took a write-off of $ 150 million to cover losses on some fixed-price defense contracts, as some new managers took a hard look at the prospects for that slow-growing business. In addition, Unisys set up an unspecified reserve -- apparently $ 60 million to $ 70 million -- to cover the minimum amount it will have to pay the government because of its involvement in the defense-procurement scandal. Unisys also noted that it paid $ 78.8 million in taxes during the quarter, even though tax payments normally would be minimal in a quarter that produced such a big loss. The tax payments will leave Unisys with $ 225 million in loss carry-forwards that will cut tax payments in future quarters. In addition, Unisys said it reduced computer inventories a further $ 100 million during the quarter, leaving it within $ 100 million of its goal of a reduction of $ 500 million by the end of the year. Still, Unisys said its European business was weak during the quarter, a worrisome sign given that the company has relied on solid results overseas to overcome weakness in the U.S. over the past several quarters. The company also reported slower growth in another important business: systems that use the Unix operating system. That would be a huge problem if it were to continue, because Unisys is betting its business on the assumption that customers want to move away from using operating systems that run on only one manufacturer 's equipment and toward systems -- mainly Unix -- that work on almost anyone 's machines. In addition, Unisys must deal with its increasingly oppressive debt load. Debt has risen to around $ 4 billion, or about 50 % of total capitalization. That means Unisys must pay about $ 100 million in interest every quarter, on top of $ 27 million in dividends on preferred stock. Jim Unruh, Unisys 's president, said he is approaching next year with caution. He said the strength of the world-wide economy is suspect, and does n't see much revenue growth in the cards. He also said that the price wars flaring up in parts of the computer industry will continue through next year. He said the move toward standard operating systems means customers are n't locked into buying from their traditional computer supplier and can force prices down. That, he said, is why Unisys is overhauling its whole business: It needs to prepare for a world in which profit margins will be lower than computer companies have been used to. \" We 've approached this not as a response to a temporary condition in the industry but as a fundamental change the industry is going through, \" Mr. Unruh said. \" The information-systems industry is still going to be a high-growth business, and we 're confident that we have tremendous assets as a company. But we do n't minimize the challenges of the near term. \" Securities analysts were even more cautious, having been burned repeatedly on Unisys this year. Some had predicted earnings of more than $ 4 a share for this year, up from last year 's fully diluted $ 3.27 a share on earnings of $ 680.6 million. But the company said Friday that it had losses of $ 673.3 million through the first nine months, compared with earnings a year earlier of $ 382.2 million, or $ 2.22 a share fully diluted, as revenue inched up 1.4 % to $ 7.13 billion from $ 7.03 billion. And Unisys is expected to do little better than break even in the fourth quarter. So Steve Milunovich at First Boston said he is cutting his earnings estimate for next year to $ 2 a share from $ 3. \" I was feeling like I was too high to begin with, \" he said. Mr. Weil of Weil amp Associates said he will remain at $ 1 a share for next year but said he wonders whether even that low target is at risk. \" The break-even point for next year is much lower, but is it low enough? \" he asked. Reflecting the concern, Unisys stock fell a further 75 cents to $ 16.25 in composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.",

    "text": "Control Data Corp., which just months ago was hemorrhaging financially, thinks it will be healthy enough soon to consider repurchasing public debt. Moreover, the company, whose go-it-alone approach nearly proved fatal, now sees alliances with others as the way back to prosperity in what it calls \" the data solutions \" business. \" I 'm not saying everything is hunky-dory, but we have completed the transition, \" Robert M. Price, chairman and chief executive, said in an interview. \" Transition \" is a reference to the company 's five-year restructuring effort. During that time, Control Data had losses of more than $ 1 billion. Now, following asset sales that shrank revenue by more than one-third this year alone, Control Data is flush with cash. So its senior executives are talking openly about possibly buying back some of the company 's $ 172.5 million in subordinated convertible debentures next year. \" We 'd like to continue to reduce debt, \" President Lawrence Perlman said. Noting that the company is offering to buy back $ 154.2 million in senior notes paying 12 3/4 %, he said the response will help determine future debt-reduction efforts. The offer was automatically triggered by the recent sale of Control Data 's Imprimis disk-drive business to Seagate Technology Inc. Mr. Perlman, who is also acting chief financial officer and the odds-on favorite to become the next chief executive, said the company is achieving \" modest positive cash flow from operations, and we expect that to continue into 1990. \" He said the company has no intention of tapping its short-term bank lines \" for a good part of 1990. \" Sometime next year, Control Data will \" develop a new bank relationship, \" Mr. Perlman said. In recent months a group of lenders, led by Bank of America, has extended Control Data up to $ 90 million in revolving loans through January, as well as $ 115 million in standby letters of credit. Loan covenants require that the company achieve specified levels of operating earnings and meet a rolling four-quarter profitability test. Last week Control Data reported third-quarter earnings of $ 9.8 million, or 23 cents a share, on revenue of $ 763 million. Through the first nine months, the company had a loss of $ 484 million, largely reflecting the closing of its supercomputer unit. While a few assets are still being shopped -- including the sports and entertainment ticketing portion of the company 's Ticketron unit -- Mr. Price said future restructuring would be a question of strategy. \" We do n't need the cash. \" Ticketron 's automated wagering business, which operates lotteries in a half dozen states, is not for sale, the company said. Rather, Mr. Perlman said, Control Data intends to bid for the coming Minnesota lottery contract and is seeking new applications for the technology overseas, where \" there is great interest in games of skill. \" He would n't elaborate. Control Data 's semiconductor business, VTC Inc., continues to lose money, the executives acknowledged, but they said they consider some of the technology vital to national defense and so are reluctant to dispose of it. The company 's strategy for keeping its computer products business profitable -- it recently achieved profitability after several quarters of losses -- calls for a narrow focus and a lid on expenses. Partly, costs will be held down through strategic technology alliances, management said. Control Data recently announced an agreement with MIPS Computer Systems Inc. to jointly develop machines with simplified operating software. James E. Ousley, computer products group president, said such arrangements could help slash Control Data 's computer research and development costs in half by the end of 1990. He disclosed that before Control Data scrapped its ETA Systems Inc. supercomputer business this past spring, those costs were running at nearly 35 % of group revenue. At the same time four of six design projects were spiked, he said. Asked how the company hopes to expand its computer hardware business, Mr. Ousley said it sees good opportunities in systems integration. \" We think we 're getting only 10 % of the integration dollars our customers are spending, \" he said. \" We 're in environments that are going to spend a lot of money on that. \" Control Data mainframes are designed for numerically intensive computing users, such as the scientific, engineering and academic communities. Utilities management is a major commercial niche. Reviewing the company 's scrape with disaster, Mr. Price conceded it had tried to do too much on its own. \" Absolutely, \" he said. But while its stock is selling at about half Control Data 's estimated breakup value, neither Messrs. Perlman nor Price said he spends much time considering the possibility of a hostile takeover. \" We 've been listed as a candidate for so long it 's not worth worrying about, \" said Mr. Price.",

    "text": "Polly Peck International Inc.'s agreement to acquire 51 % of Sansui Electric Co. proves that foreign companies can acquire Japanese companies -- if the alternative for the Japanese company is extinction. Polly Peck, a fast-growing British conglomerate, will pay 15.6 billion yen ( $ 110 million ) for 39 million new shares of Sansui, a well-known maker of high-fidelity audio equipment that failed to adjust to changing market conditions. Japanese government officials, eager to rebut foreign criticism of Japanese investments overseas, hailed the transaction as proof foreigners can make similar investments in Japan. Polly Peck 's chairman, Asil Nadir, echoed the official Japanese view of the accord, which was announced Friday. \" The myths that Japan is not open to concerns from outside has, I think, been demolished at a stroke, \" Mr. Nadir said. But analysts say Sansui is a special case. It expects to post a loss of 6.4 billion yen for the year ending tomorrow and its liabilities currently exceed its assets by about 13.8 billion yen. \" If you find sound, healthy companies in Japan, they are not for sale, \" said George Watanabe, a management-consultant at Tokyo-based Asia Advisory Services Inc. Statistics on acquisitions by foreigners vary in detail, because unlike Sansui, which is listed on the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges, most of the Japanese companies acquired by foreigners are privately held. But by all accounts foreign companies have bought only a relative handful of Japanese companies this year, while Japanese companies have acquired hundreds of foreign companies. Nor do analysts expect the Sansui deal to touch off a fresh wave of foreign purchases. If the strong yen and the high stock prices of Japanese companies were n't deterrents enough, webs of cross-shareholdings between friendly Japanese companies and fiercely independent Japanese corporate attitudes repel most would-be acquirers. Usually when a Japanese company is ready to sell, it has few alternatives remaining, and the grim demeanors of Sansui 's directors at a joint news conference here left little doubt that this was not the company 's finest hour. Sansui was once one of Japan 's premier makers of expensive, high-quality stereo gear for audiophiles. But in recent years, the market has moved toward less expensive \" mini-component \" sets, miniaturized amplifiers and receivers and software players that could be stacked on top of each other. Some of Sansui 's fellow audio-specialty companies, such as Aiwa Co. and Pioneer Electric Corp., responded to the challenge by quickly bringing out mini-component products of their own, by moving heavily into the booming compact disk businesses or by diversifying into other consumer-electronics fields, including laser disks or portable cassette players. Sansui was late into the mini-component business and failed to branch into other new businesses. As the yen soared in recent years, Sansui 's deepening financial problems became a vicious circle. While competitors moved production offshore in response to the sagging competitiveness of Japanese factories, Sansui lacked the money to build new plants in Southeast Asia. \" Our company has not been able to cope very effectively with \" changes in the marketplace, said Ryosuke Ito, Sansui 's president. But even a Japanese company that looks like a dog may turn out to be a good investment for a foreign concern, some management consultants maintain. Yoshihisa Murasawa, a management consultant for Booz - Allen amp Hamilton ( Japan ) Inc., said his firm will likely be recommending acquisitions of Japanese companies more often to foreign clients in the future. \" Attitudes { toward being acquired } are still negative, but they 're becoming more positive, \" Mr. Murasawa said. \" In some industries, like pharmaceuticals, acquisitions make sense. \" Whether Polly Peck 's acquisition makes sense remains to be seen, but at the news conference, Mr. Nadir brimmed with self-confidence that he can turn Sansui around. Sansui, he said, is a perfect fit for Polly Peck 's electronics operations, which make televisions, videocassette recorders, microwaves and other products on an \" original equipment maker \" basis for sale under other companies ' brand names. He said Polly Peck will greatly expand Sansui 's product line, using Sansui 's engineers to design the new products, and will move Sansui 's production of most products other than sophisticated audio gear offshore into Polly Peck 's own factories. \" Whatever capital it ( Sansui ) needs so it can compete and become a totally global entity capable of competing with the best in the world, that capital will be injected, \" Mr. Nadir said. And while Polly Peck is n't jettisoning the existent top-management structure of Sansui, it is bringing in a former Toshiba Corp. executive as executive vice president and chief operating officer. Such risk taking is an everyday matter for the brash Mr. Nadir, who is 25 % owner of Polly Peck as well as its chairman. He took Polly Peck, once a small fabric wholesaler, and used it at as a base to build a conglomerate that has been doubling its profits annually since 1980. In September, it announced plans to acquire the tropical-fruit business of RJR Nabisco Inc.'s Del Monte foods unit for # 557 million ( $ 878 million ). Last month, Polly Peck posted a 38 % jump in pretax profit for the first half to # 54.8 million from # 39.8 million on a 63 % rise in sales. Joann S. Lublin in London contributed to this article.",

    "text": "The bolstered cellular agreement between BellSouth Corp. and LIN Broadcasting Corp. carries heightened risks and could fail to fend off McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., the rival suitor for LIN. Moreover, the amended pact shows how McCaw 's persistence has pushed LIN and BellSouth into a corner, forcing huge debt on the proposed new company. The debt, estimated at $ 4.7 billion, could mortgage the cellular company 's future earning power in order to placate some LIN holders in the short term. The plan still calls for LIN to combine its cellular telephone properties with BellSouth 's and to spin off its broadcasting operations. But under new terms of the agreement, announced Friday, LIN holders would receive a special cash dividend of $ 42 a share, representing a payout of about $ 2.23 billion, shortly before the proposed merger. LIN said it expects to borrow the money to pay the dividend, but commitments from banks still have n't been obtained. Under previous terms, holders would have received a dividend of only $ 20 a share. In addition, New York-based LIN would exercise its right to buy out for $ 1.9 billion the 55 % equity interest of its partner, Metromedia Co., in a New York cellular franchise. That money also would have to be borrowed. In effect, McCaw has forced LIN 's hand by bidding $ 1.9 billion for the stake earlier this month. \" We 're taking on more debt than we would have liked to, \" acknowledged Michael Plouf, LIN 's vice president and treasurer. Although he expressed confidence that the proposed new company 's cash flow would be sufficient to cover interest payments on the debt, he estimated that the company would n't be profitable until 1994 or later. Analyst estimate the value of the BellSouth proposal at about $ 115 to $ 125 a share. They value McCaw 's bid at $ 112 to $ 118 a share. The previous BellSouth pact was valued at about $ 98 to $ 110 a share. McCaw, the largest provider of cellular telephone service in the U.S., already owns about 9.4 % of LIN 's stock. In response to BellSouth 's amended pact, the Kirkland, Wash., company extended its own offer to buy 22 million LIN shares for $ 125 apiece, which would give McCaw a 50.3 % controlling interest. Over the weekend, McCaw continued to call for an auction of LIN. Analysts said they expect McCaw to escalate the bidding again. \" This game is n't over yet, \" said Joel D. Gross, a vice president at Donaldson, Lufkin amp Jenrette Securities Corp. \" At some point, it will become non-economical for one company. But I do n't think we 're at that point yet. \" Under its revised proposal, Atlanta-based BellSouth would have a 50 % interest in the new cellular company and would be responsible for half of its debt. To sweeten the pact further -- and to ease concerns of institutional investors -- BellSouth added a provision designed to give extra protection to holders if the regional Bell company ever decides to buy the rest of the new cellular company. The provision, described as \" back-end \" protection, would require BellSouth to pay a price equivalent to what an outside party might have to pay. McCaw 's bid also has a similar clause. Only McCaw 's proposal requires the company to begin an auction process in June 1994 for remaining shares at third-party prices. To mollify shareholders concerned about the long-term value of the company under the BellSouth - LIN agreement, BellSouth also agreed to pay as much as $ 10 a share, or $ 540 million, if, after five years, the trading value of the new cellular company is n't as high as the value that shareholders would have realized from the McCaw offer. \" We 're very pleased with the new deal. We did n't expect BellSouth to be so responsive, \" said Frederick A. Moran, president of Moran Asset Management Inc., which holds 500,000 LIN shares. BellSouth 's \" back-end protection was flawed previously. We think this is a superior deal to McCaw 's. We 're surprised. We did n't think a sleeping { Bell } mentality would be willing to take on dilution. \" But Kenneth Leon, a telecommunications analyst with Bear, Stearns amp Co., finds the BellSouth proposal still flawed because the company does n't have to wait five years to begin buying more LIN shares. \" How many shares will be around in 1995? \" he asked. \" There 's nothing preventing BellSouth from buying up shares in the meanwhile. \" BellSouth 's revised proposal surprised many industry analysts, especially because of the company 's willingness to accept some dilution of future earnings. William O. McCoy, president of the company 's BellSouth Enterprises Inc. unit, said the revised agreement with LIN would dilute BellSouth earnings by about 9 % in both 1990 and 1991 and by significantly less thereafter. Indeed, BellSouth 's cellular operations were among the first in the country to become profitable. For 1988, BellSouth earned $ 1.7 billion, or $ 3.51 a share, on revenue of $ 13.6 billion. Analysts were predicting 1990 BellSouth earnings in the range of $ 3.90 a share, or $ 1.9 billion, but now those estimates are being scaled back. In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, BellSouth shares fell 87.5 cents to $ 52.125. In national over-the-counter trading, LIN shares soared $ 4.625 to closed at $ 112.625, while McCaw fell $ 2.50 a share to $ 37.75. The proposed BellSouth - LIN cellular company, including the newly acquired Metromedia stake, would give the new entity 55 million potential customers, including about 35 million in the nation 's top 10 markets. Mr. Leon of Bear Stearns speculated that McCaw, in an attempt to buy time, might consider filing an antitrust suit against BellSouth with the Justice Department and U.S. District Judge Harold Greene, who oversees enforcement of the consent decree that broke up the Bell system in 1984. Indeed, McCaw seemed to hint at that option in a brief statement. Urging LIN directors to conduct \" a fair auction on a level playing field, \" McCaw asked how well the public interest would be served \" with the Bell operating companies controlling over 94 % of all cellular { potential customers } in the nation 's top 10 markets. \"",

    "text": "Market makers in Nasdaq over-the-counter stocks are adding their voices to the swelling chorus of complaints about program trading. Their motivation, however, has a strong practical aspect: Program trading is hazardous to their paychecks. The most controversial form of program trading, stock-index arbitrage, is \" making it tough for traders to make money, \" declares Robert Antolini, head of OTC trading at Donaldson, Lufkin amp Jenrette. Stock-index arbitrage -- the computer-guided buying and selling of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from fleeting price discrepancies -- affects the OTC market directly through the 31 stocks included in Standard amp Poor 's 500-stock index. The SampP 500 is often used in arbitrage strategies. The portion of OTC volume attributable to program trading is n't known, as it is on the New York Stock Exchange, where it amounted to more than 13 % in September. Estimates from traders put it at less than 5 % of Nasdaq 's average daily volume of roughly 133 million shares. Other market-maker gripes: Program trading also causes the Nasdaq Composite Index to lose ground against other segments of the stock market. Because of program trading it is more difficult to trade many OTC stocks without sharp price moves, a condition known as illiquidity. Moreover, the price volatility that is amplified by program trading is undercutting efforts to woo individual investors back to an OTC market that sorely misses them. Some of these problems are neither new nor unique to the OTC market. But the big, often tumultuous slide in stock prices this month has turned some of those who have been profiting from the practice against it. Peter DaPuzzo, head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, acknowledges that he was n't troubled by program trading when it began in the pre-crash bull market because it added liquidity and people were pleased to see stock prices rising. \" We were n't as concerned until they became sell programs, \" says Mr. DaPuzzo, who now thinks it adds unnecessary volatility. Shearson Lehman, however, executes program trades for clients. Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Kidder Peabody, in addition to Shearson, do program-trade OTC stocks. Shearson, Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs say they do so only for customers, however. Kidder Peabody does program trading for its own as well as clients ' accounts. Of course, there were sell programs in past years, too, but they seem to hurt market makers more painfully these days. That 's largely because of defensive measures they adopted after the 1987 crash, when individual investors fled the market and trading activity dwindled. Market makers, to cut costs, slashed inventories of stocks they keep on hand to sell investors when other holders are n't selling. And to protect their reduced capital investment from eroding further, market makers became quicker to lower price quotes when sell programs are in progress. On days when prices are tumbling, they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will. In such an environment, market makers can suffer huge losses both on trades made that day at steadily dropping prices and in the value of their inventories of shares. \" It makes no sense for us to put money at risk when you know you 're going to lose, \" says Mr. Antolini, of Donaldson Lufkin. But this skittishness, Mr. Antolini says, is creating liquidity problems in certain OTC stocks. \" It 's harder to sell stocks when the sell programs come in because some market makers do n't want to { take the orders }. No one has big positions and no one wants to take big risks. \" Joseph Hardiman, president of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees trading on Nasdaq, agrees that program trading is hurting the market 's efforts to bring back small investors. But, he observes, while makers suffer losses when program trading drags the market down, they also make money when program trading pushes the prices higher. \" Sometimes { traders } lose sight of that, \" he says. The OTC stocks in the SampP 500 include Nasdaq 's biggest, such as Apple Computer, MCI Communications, Tele - Communications and Liz Claiborne. These big stocks greatly influence the Nasdaq Composite Index. When the computers say \" sell, \" the composite tumbles as well as the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The problem, market makers say, is that while the industrial average and the SampP 500 usually recover as buy programs kick in, the Nasdaq Composite frequently is left behind. Eight trading days after Oct. 12, the day before the stock market plunge, for instance, the Nasdaq Composite had fallen 4.3 %, compared with 3.3 % for the SampP 500, 3.5 % for the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index and 3.6 % for the industrial average. This gap eventually closes, but slowly. Three days later, as of Friday 's close, the Nasdaq Composite was down 6 %, compared with 5.9 % for the industrial average, 5.7 % for the SampP 500 and 5.8 % for the Big Board Composite. The main reason for this lag is that individual investors own 65 % of the OTC market 's capitalization, according to Mr. Hardiman, much more than on the Big Board. Such investors tend to be more cautious than institutional investors are about re-entering the market after massive selloffs, market makers say. The Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 5.39, or 1.2 % to 452.76 on Friday. For the week, the index dropped 3.8 %. Weakness in big technology stocks hurt the composite as well as the Nasdaq 100 Index, which fell 1.4 %, or 6.43, on Friday, to 437.68. The Nasdaq Financial Index lost about 1 %, or 3.95, to 448.80. Friday 's trading volume totaled 132.8 million shares. The average daily share turnover for October is almost 148 million shares. LIN Broadcasting surged 4 5/8 to 112 5/8; LIN and BellSouth sweetened their merger agreement in an attempt to keep shareholders from tendering their shares to McCaw Cellular Communications. McCaw, which dropped 2 1/2 to 37 3/4, has offered $ 125 a share for a majority of LIN 's shares. The revised LIN - BellSouth agreement boosts the dollar amount of the special dividend LIN promises to pay shareholders. LIN now plans to dole out $ 42 a share in cash, up from the earlier $ 20 amount. Intel eased 1/8 to 31 7/8. The semiconductor concern said the interruption in shipment of its 80486 computer chip will be brief and have little impact on the company 's earnings. The stock fell 7/8 Thursday amid concerns over problems discovered with the chip. Intel told analysts that the company will resume shipments of the chips within two to three weeks. Weisfield 's rocketed 9 1/2 to 39 after the jewelry store operator said it is in preliminary discussions, with a party it would n't identify, regarding the possible acquisition of the company. Starpointe Savings Bank rose 3 to 20 after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. approved Dime Savings Bank of New York 's $ 21-a-share acquisition of Starpointe. Kirschner Medical fell 4 to 15. The company said its third-quarter earnings will probably be lower than the 16 cents a share it reported last year, despite a rise in the company 's revenue. Kirschner earned $ 376,000 on revenue of $ 14.5 million in the 1988 quarter. The company blamed a number of factors for the earnings decline, including softer sales of joint-implants.",

    "text": "London share prices closed sharply lower Friday in active trading after Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson 's resignation slapped the market and Wall Street 's rapid initial sell-off knocked it down. London shares were depressed initially by overnight losses in New York and by the drop in sterling after Mr. Lawson 's resignation. It showed some early resilience after central bank support firmed sterling, but the weight of Wall Street late in London trading, and signs of further weakness in the British pound, proved a hefty load to bear. New York stocks recovered some of their losses after the London market closed. The Financial Times 100-share index shed 47.3 points to close at 2082.1, down 4.5 % from the previous Friday and 6.8 % from Oct. 13, when Wall Street 's plunge helped spark the current weakness in London. The 30-share index settled 42.0 points lower at 1678.5. Volume was 840.8 million shares, up from 443.6 million Thursday and the week 's most active session. Dealers said the turnover, largely confined to the 100-share index stocks, partly reflected the flurry of activity typical at the close of a two-week trading account and the start of a new account. But they said Friday 's focus on the top-tier stocks telegraphed active overseas selling and showed the broad-based fears over the status of the U.K. economy and Britain 's currency in the wake of the upheaval in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 's cabinet. A senior dealer with Warburg Securities noted British Gas, the most active blue-chip stock at 20 million shares traded, was affected by the political implications of Mr. Lawson 's departure and Mrs. Thatcher 's cabinet shuffle. He attributed the unusually high volume to broad-based selling on fears that the Thatcher government may be in turmoil and Britain 's Labor Party positioned to regain control of the government and renew efforts at nationalization. British Gas shed 8.5 pence a share to close at 185 pence ( $ 2.90 ). Other dealers added that the blue-chip stocks in general were hit by profit-taking over concerns that London shares will continue posting declines and the uncertainty over sterling given that Mr. Lawson 's successor, John Major, had only been in the job one day. Besides British Gas, British Steel skidded 1.74 to 123.5 on turnover of 11 million shares. British Petroleum fell 5 to 286 on 14 million shares traded. Dealers said the multinational oil company was pressured by recent brokerage recommendations urging investors to switch into Shell Trading amp Transport. Shell eased 1 to 416 on turnover of 4.8 million shares. Among the other actively traded blue-chip issues, Imperial Chemical Industries dropped 11 to # 10.86, Hanson skidded 9.5 to 200.5, and British Telecom fell 10 to 250. In Tokyo, stocks closed lower but above intraday lows in active trading. The Nikkei index was pressured down by profit-taking triggered by sharp advances made through this week and fell 151.20 points to 35527.29. In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the Nikkei index fell 148.85 points to 35378.44. On Friday, the Tokyo stock price index of first section issues was down 15.82 at 2681.76. First-section volume was estimated at 1.3 billion shares, up from 886 million shares Thursday. An official at Wako Securities said brokerages ' excessive expectations about recent advances in Tokyu Group shares and real estate issues were dashed Friday. Dealers placed heavy buy orders in the morning to start the first trading day for November transactions. But they failed to sell these stocks to client investors, who were cautious about the sharp gains these issues made this week, the Wako official said. Fund managers said Friday 's profittaking was a natural result of the week 's \" abnormal fever \" in buying real estate, shipbuilding, steel and construction shares. Frankfurt prices closed lower again Friday, the fourth decline in the past five days and the culmination of a week that saw the DAX index lose 4 %. The DAX dropped 19.69 points Friday to 1462.93. Traders said the continued turbulence in other markets, coupled with the drop in London following the Lawson resignation, were responsible. Traders said that selling pressure was n't enormous and that the DAX dropped Friday more on a lack of any substantial buying interest. They said contributing to the downward drift was the fact that many professional traders had chosen to square positions ahead of the weekend. \" It 's the whole uncertainty about what 's happening around us, \" said Valentin Von Korff, a trader at Credit Suisse First Boston in Frankfurt. \" If you take away the outside influences, the market itself looks very cheap. What 's happening here is n't justified by the fundamentals. \" Traders said the market remains extremely nervous because of the wild swings seen on the New York Stock Exchange last week. That 's leaving small investors with cold feet, they said, and prompting institutions to take a reserved stance on the sidelines as well, at least until the market in New York settles down somewhat. Elsewhere, share prices closed lower in Paris, Zurich, Amsterdam, Brussels and Stockholm, and were mixed in Milan. The British shakeup was widely cited for the declines. Share prices also closed lower in Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taipei, Manila, Wellington and Seoul. Concern about declines in other markets, especially New York, caused selling pressure. Here are price trends on the world 's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.",

    "text": "This has n't been Kellogg Co.'s year. The oat-bran craze has cost the world 's largest cereal maker market share. The company 's president quit suddenly. And now Kellogg is indefinitely suspending work on what was to be a $ 1 billion cereal plant. The company said it was delaying construction because of current market conditions. But the Memphis, Tenn., facility was n't to begin turning out product until 1993, so the decision may reveal a more pessimistic long-term outlook as well. Kellogg, which has n't been as successful in capitalizing on the public 's health-oriented desire for oat bran as rival General Mills Inc., has been losing share in the $ 6 billion ready-to-eat cereal market. Kellogg 's current share is believed to be slightly under 40 % while General Mills ' share is about 27 %. Led by its oat-based Cheerios line, General Mills has gained an estimated 2 % share so far this year, mostly at the expense of Kellogg. Each share point is worth about $ 60 million in sales. Analysts say much of Kellogg 's erosion has been in such core brands as Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies and Frosted Flakes, which represent nearly one-third of its sales volume. Kellogg is so anxious to turn around Corn Flakes sales that it soon will begin selling boxes for as little as 99 cents, trade sources say. \" Cheerios and Honey Nut Cheerios have eaten away sales normally going to Kellogg 's corn-based lines simply because they are made of oats, \" says Merrill Lynch food analyst William Maguire. \" They are not a happy group of people at Battle Creek right now. \" Kellogg is based in Battle Creek, Mich., a city that calls itself the breakfast capital of the world. Another analyst, John C. Maxwell Jr. of Wheat, First Securities in Richmond, Va., recently went to a \" sell \" recommendation on Kellogg stock, which closed Friday at $ 71.75, down 75 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. \" I do n't think Kellogg can get back to 40 % this year, \" he said. \" Kellogg 's main problem is life style. People are reading the boxes and deciding they want something that 's ` healthy ' for you -- oats, bran. \" Mr. Maxwell said he would n't be surprised if, over the next two years or so, General Mills ' share increased to 30 % or more. In announcing the plant delay, Kellogg Chairman William E. LaMothe said, \" Cereal volume growth in the U.S. has not met our expectations for 1989 \". He said construction would n't resume until market conditions warrant it. Kellogg indicated that it has room to grow without adding facilities. The company has five other U.S. plants, including a modern facility at its Battle Creek headquarters known as Building 100, which is to add bran-processing and rice-processing capacity next year. General Mills, meanwhile, finds itself constrained from boosting sales further because its plants are operating at capacity. A large plant in Covington, Ga., is to come on line next year. A Kellogg officer, who asked not to be named, said the Memphis project was \" pulled in for a reconsideration of costs, \" an indication that the ambitious plans might be scaled back in any future construction. Initial cost estimates for the plant, which was to have been built in phases, ranged from $ 1 billion to $ 1.2 billion. A company spokesman said it was \" possible, but highly unlikely, \" that the plant might never be built. \" As we regain our leadership level where we have been, and as we continue to put new products into the marketplace and need additional capacity, we will look at resuming our involvement with our plan, \" he said. The new facility was to have been the world 's most advanced cereal manufacturing plant, and Kellogg 's largest construction project. The company had retained the Fluor Daniel unit of Fluor Corp. as general contractor. But in recent weeks, construction-industry sources reported that early preparation work was slowing at the 185-acre site. Subcontractors said they were told that equipment orders would be delayed. Fluor Daniel already has reassigned most of its work crew, the sources said. Last Friday 's announcement was the first official word that the project was in trouble and that the company 's plans for a surge in market share may have been overly optimistic. Until recently, Kellogg had been telling its sales force and Wall Street that by 1992 it intended to achieve a 50 % share of market, measured in dollar volume. Although he called current market conditions \" highly competitive, \" Mr. LaMothe, Kellogg 's chairman and chief executive officer, forecast an earnings increase for the full year. Last year, the company earned $ 480.4 million, or $ 3.90 a share, on sales of $ 4.3 billion. As expected, Kellogg reported lower third-quarter earnings. Net fell 16 % to $ 123.1 million, or $ 1.02 a share, from $ 145.7 million, or $ 1.18 a share. Sales rose 4.8 % to $ 1.20 billion from $ 1.14 billion. The company had a one-time charge of $ 14.8 million in the latest quarter covering the disposition of certain assets. The company would n't elaborate, citing competitive reasons.",

    "text": "General Motors Corp. wants to buy as much as 15 % of Jaguar PLC, marking its first salvo in a possible full-scale battle against Ford Motor Co. for control of the British car maker. GM sought U.S. antitrust clearance last week to purchase more than $ 15 million worth of Jaguar shares but does n't own any yet, according to GM officials here and at the company 's Detroit headquarters. The No. 1 U.S. auto maker then wrote Jaguar that it intends \" to go to that 15 % \" level once it wins the U.S. clearance to go beyond $ 15 million, a Jaguar spokesman said yesterday. The GM move follows Tuesday 's declaration by Ford, which holds an unwelcome 12.45 % stake in Jaguar, that it is prepared to bid for the entire company. GM is close to completing a friendly deal with Jaguar that is likely to involve an eventual 30 % stake and joint manufacturing ventures. Speculative investors, betting on an imminent clash between Ford and GM, pushed up Jaguar 's share price five pence ( eight U.S. cents ) to a near-record 720 pence ( $ 11.60 ) in late trading on London 's stock exchange yesterday. Since Tuesday, the shares have gained nearly 4 %. But an all-out bidding war between the world 's top auto giants for Britain 's leading luxury-car maker seems unlikely. \" We will not go over a certain level, \" said David N. McCammon, Ford 's vice president for finance, at a news conference yesterday in Dearborn, Mich. \" There 's some price at which we 'd stop bidding. \" He would n't specify what it was. And powerful political pressures may convince the Conservative government to keep its so-called golden share, which limits any individual holding to 15 %, until the restriction expires on Dec. 31, 1990. \" I really do n't see the government doing something that Jaguar does n't want over the next 14 months, \" said Kenneth Warren, a Conservative member of Parliament and chairman of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry in Britain 's House of Commons. \" The golden share is a single share, but it is the magic share. \" The government retained the single share after selling its stake in Jaguar in 1984 -- part of a nationalistic practice of protecting former government-owned enterprises to deflect criticism of privatization. The 15 % restriction covers any would-be suitor, British or foreign. Ford is willing to bid for 100 % of Jaguar 's shares if both the government and Jaguar shareholders agree to relax the anti-takeover barrier prematurely. As Jaguar 's biggest holder and Britain 's biggest car maker, Ford could turn up the heat by convening a special shareholders ' meeting and urging holders to drop the limits early. Ford might succeed because many shareholders are speculators keen for a full bid or institutional investors unhappy over Jaguar management 's handling of its current financial difficulties. The government probably would n't give in readily to a hostile foray by Ford, however. It has relinquished a golden share only once before -- during British Petroleum Co.'s # 2.5 billion ( $ 4 billion ) takeover of Britoil PLC in 1988. In wooing British lawmakers, GM has pointed out that its willingness to settle for a minority stake would keep Jaguar British-owned and independent. This week, the U.S. auto giant paid for 10 House of Commons members and two House of Lords members to fly to Detroit and tour its operations there. While the visit was unrelated to Jaguar, GM Chairman Roger Smith answered the legislators ' questions about it over lunch Tuesday. He said Jaguar \" should n't be smothered by anyone else, \" recalled one participant. Politics also influences the government 's thinking on the anti-takeover restriction. The Conservatives do n't dare jeopardize marginal Tory seats in Coventry, where Jaguar has headquarters, nor can the government easily back down on promised protection for a privatized company while it proceeds with controversial plans to privatize most of Britain 's water and electricity industries. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher might, however, be receptive to any request by Jaguar Chairman Sir John Egan for the restriction 's early removal to let GM amass more than 15 % or mount a friendly suitor bid against Ford. In the end, Sir John -- rather than the government or Jaguar shareholders -- may hold the key that unlocks the golden share.",

    "text": "Billions of investors ' dollars are pouring out of the nation 's junk-bond mutual funds, undermining a pillar of support in the already reeling junk market. Last week alone, an eye-popping $ 1.6 billion flowed out of the junk funds, or nearly 5 % of their total assets, according to estimates by Dalbar Financial Services Inc., a Boston research firm. In the past two months the nation 's 88 junk funds have lost a total of about $ 6 billion -- more than 15 % of assets -- through sales or transfers of junk-fund shares, Dalbar says. It made the estimates based on data collected from more than a dozen big junk funds. Interviews with three major fund groups -- Fidelity Investments, Vanguard Group Inc. and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. -- confirm the trend. Their junk funds combined have had net outflows totaling nearly $ 500 million, or about 13 % of their junk fund assets, in the past two months. Some fund managers say negative publicity has exacerbated investors ' concern about recent declines in junk-bond prices. \" People have been seeing headline after headline after headline and saying: ` I ca n't take it anymore -- I 'm getting out, ' \" says Kurt Brouwer of Brouwer amp Janachowski, a San Francisco investment adviser. The withdrawals could spell trouble for the $ 200 billion junk market. If the heavy outflows continue, fund managers will face increasing pressure to sell off some of their junk to pay departing investors in the weeks ahead. Such selling could erode prices of high-yield junk bonds, already weakened by a rash of corporate credit problems. Mutual fund groups have n't lost control of much of the outgoing money, says Louis Harvey, Dalbar 's president. Mutual fund officials say that investors have transferred most of it into their money market accounts, and to a lesser extent, government-bond funds. So the impact on the $ 950 billion mutual fund industry as a whole probably will be slight. But tremors are likely in the junk-bond market, which has helped to finance the takeover boom of recent years. Mutual funds are the among the largest holders of junk, accounting for more than a quarter of the entire high-yield, high-risk market. The 88 mutual funds investing solely in junk bonds hold assets of about $ 32 billion. Other funds hold a smattering of junk bonds, too. The $ 1.5 billion Fidelity High Income Fund has had a net outflow of about $ 150 million in the past two months. About $ 60 million streamed out last week alone, double the level of the week following last month 's Campeau Corp. credit squeeze. About 98 % of the outflow was transferred to other Fidelity funds, says Neal Litvack, a Fidelity vice president, marketing, with most going into money market funds. \" You get a news item, it hits, you have strong redemptions that day and for two days following -- then go back to normal, \" says Mr. Litvack. The fund, with a cash cushion of more than 10 %, has \" met all the redemptions without having to sell one thing, \" Mr. Litvack says. He adds: \" Our fund has had { positive } net sales every month for the last three years -- until this month. \" Vanguard 's $ 1 billion High Yield Bond Portfolio has seen $ 161 million flow out since early September; $ 14 million of that seeped out Friday Oct. 13 alone. Still, two-thirds of the outflow has been steered into other Vanguard portfolios, says Brian Mattes, a vice president. The fund now holds a cash position of about 15 %. At the $ 932 million T. Rowe Price High Yield Fund, investors yanked out about $ 182 million in the past two months. Those withdrawals, most of which were transferred to other T. Rowe Price funds, followed little change in the fund 's sales picture this year through August. \" The last two months have been the whole ball game, \" says Steven Norwitz, a vice president. Junk-fund holders have barely broken even this year, as fat interest payments barely managed to offset declining prices. Through Oct. 19, high-yield funds had an average 0.85 % total return ( the price change plus dividends on fund shares ), according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc. That 's even less than the 4.35 % total return of the Merrill Lynch High - Yield Index. Fidelity 's junk fund has fallen 2.08 % this year through Oct. 19, Lipper says; the Vanguard fund rose 1.84 %; and the T. Rowe Price fund edged up 0.66 %. People who remain in junk funds now could get hit again, some analysts and fund specialists say. Many funds in recent weeks and months have been selling their highest-quality junk issues, such as RJR Nabisco, to raise cash to meet expected redemptions. Funds might be forced to accept lower prices if they expand their selling to the securities of less-creditworthy borrowers. And then, asset values of the funds could plunge more than they have so far. Says Michael Hirsch, chief investment officer of Republic National Bank and manager of the FundTrust Group in New York: \" It 's a time bomb just waiting to go off. \"",

    "text": "The government is sharpening its newest weapon against white-collar defendants: the power to prevent them from paying their legal bills. And defense lawyers are warning that they wo n't stick around if they do n't get paid. The issue has come to a boil in Newark, N.J., where federal prosecutors have warned lawyers for Eddie Antar that if the founder and former chairman of Crazy Eddie Inc. is indicted, the government may move to seize the money that Mr. Antar is using to pay legal fees. The warning by the U.S. attorney 's office follows two decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court last June. In those cases, the high court ruled that federal law gives prosecutors broad authority to seize assets of people accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes, including fees paid to lawyers before an indictment. If the government succeeds in seizing Mr. Antar 's assets, he could be left without top-flight legal representation, because his attorneys are likely to quit, according to individuals familiar with the case. A seizure also would make the case the largest -- and one of the first -- in which lawyers ' fees have been confiscated in a prosecution unrelated to drugs. \" The people who suffer in the short run are defendants, but the people who suffer in the long run are all of the people, because there wo n't be a vigorous private bar to defend the Bill of Rights, \" says Gerald Lefcourt, a criminal defense attorney who says he has turned down a number of cases to avoid possible fee seizures. Mr. Antar is being investigated by a federal grand jury in Newark, where prosecutors have told him that they may soon seek an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges. Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, or RICO, the government has the authority to seek to freeze or seize a defendant 's assets before trial. According to individuals familiar with Mr. Antar 's case, prosecutors issued their warning this week after one of Mr. Antar 's attorneys asked whether legal fees might be subject to seizure. In a letter, prosecutors told Mr. Antar 's lawyers that because of the recent Supreme Court rulings, they could expect that any fees collected from Mr. Antar may be seized. Prosecutors have told Mr. Antar 's attorneys that they believe Mr. Antar 's allegedly ill-gotten gains are so great that any money he has used to pay attorneys derives from illegal activities. Therefore, they said, the money can be taken from the lawyers even after they are paid. Justin Feldman and Jack Arseneault, attorneys for Mr. Antar, both declined to comment on the matter. In Newark, U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito said, \" I do n't think there 's any legal reason to limit forfeiture of attorney 's fees to drug cases. \" Mr. Alito said his office \" just responded to an attorney 's question about whether we would go after attorney 's fees, and that is different from actually doing it, although we reserve that right. \" Mr. Antar was charged last month in a civil suit filed in federal court in Newark by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In that suit, the SEC accused Mr. Antar of engaging in a \" massive financial fraud \" to overstate the earnings of Crazy Eddie, Edison, N.J., over a three-year period. Through his lawyers, Mr. Antar has denied allegations in the SEC suit and in civil suits previously filed by shareholders against Mr. Antar and others. The SEC has alleged that Mr. Antar aimed to pump up the company 's stock price through false financial statements in order to sell his stake and reap huge profits. Mr. Antar, the SEC said, made more than $ 60 million from the sale of his shares between 1985 and 1987. The Justice Department has emphasized that the government 's fee-forfeiture power is to be used sparingly. According to department policy, prosecutors must make a strong showing that lawyers ' fees came from assets tainted by illegal profits before any attempts at seizure are made. Still, criminal defense lawyers worry that defendants are being deprived of their Sixth Amendment right to counsel and a fair trial if the government can seize lawyers ' fees. They also worry that if the government applies asset-forfeiture laws broadly, the best defense lawyers will be unwilling to take criminal cases unless they are assured of being paid.",

    "text": "Intel Corp.'s most powerful computer chip has flaws that could delay several computer makers ' marketing efforts, but the \" bugs \" are n't expected to hurt Intel and most computer makers. Computer experts familiar with the flaws, found in Intel 's 80486 chip, say the defects do n't affect the average user and are likely to be cleared up before most computers using the chip as their \" brains \" appear on the market sometime next year. Intel said that last week a customer discovered two flaws in its 80486 microprocessor chip 's \" floating-point unit \", a set of circuits that do certain calculations. On Friday, Intel began notifying customers about the bugs which cause the chip to give wrong answers for some mathematical calculations. But while International Business Machines Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp. say the bugs will delay products, most big computer makers said the flaws do n't affect them. \" Bugs like this are just a normal part of product development, \" said Richard Archuleta, director of Hewlett - Packard Co.'s advanced systems development. Hewlett announced last week that it planned to ship a computer based on the 486 chip early next year. \" These bugs do n't affect our schedule at all, \" he said. Likewise, AST Research Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc. said the bugs wo n't delay their development of 486-based machines. \" We have n't modified our schedules in any way, \" said a Sun spokesman. To switch to another vendor 's chips, \" would not definitely be an option, \" he said. Nonetheless, concern about the chip may have been responsible for a decline of 87.5 cents in Intel 's stock to $ 32 a share yesterday in over-the-counter trading, on volume of 3,609,800 shares, and partly responsible for a drop in Compaq 's stock in New York Stock Exchange composite trading on Wednesday. Yesterday, Compaq plunged further, closing at $ 100 a share, off $ 8.625 a share, on volume of 2,633,700 shares. Most of Compaq 's decline is being attributed to a third-quarter earnings report that came in at the low end of analysts ' expectations. Intel said it had corrected the problems and would start producing bugless chips next week. \" We should not be seeing any more, \" said Bill Rash, Intel 's director for the 486 chip. What 's more, the bugs only emerge on esoteric applications such as computer-aided design and scientific calculations, he said, and then very seldom. \" These errata do not affect business programs, \" he said. The bugs will cause problems in \" specific and rare circumstances that will not occur in typical applications \" such as word-processing and spreadsheets, said Michael Slater, editor of the Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter. Sun, Hewlett - Packard and others say Intel is n't wholly to blame for the snafu. The real culprits, they said, are computer makers such as IBM that have jumped the gun to unveil 486-based products. \" The reason this is getting so much visibility is that some started shipping and announced early availability, \" said Hewlett - Packard 's Mr. Archuleta. \" You can do that but you 're taking a risk. Those companies are paying the price for taking the risk. \" In late September, IBM began shipping a plug-in card that converts its PS / 2 model 70-A21 from a 80386 machine to an 80486 machine. An IBM spokeswoman said the company told customers Monday about the bugs and temporarily stopped shipping the product. IBM has no plans to recall its add-on cards, the spokeswoman said, and could probably circumvent the bugs without long product delays. \" We do n't look at this as a major problem for us, \" she said. Compaq, which said it discovered the bugs, still plans to announce new 486 products on Nov. 6. Because of the glitch, however, the company said it does n't know when its machine will be commercially available. That 's a break from Compaq tradition, because the company does n't announce products until they 're actually at the dealers. The problem is being ballyhooed, experts say, because the 486 is Intel 's future flagship. Intel 's microprocessors are the chips of choice in many of today 's personal computers and the 80486 microprocessor is the spearhead of the company 's bid to guard that spot in the next generation of machines. \" Although these sorts of bugs are not at all uncommon, the 486 is an extremely high-profile product, \" said Mr. Slater, the newsletter editor. Intel 's 80486 chip is the Corvette of Intel 's microprocessors, a super-fast, super-expensive chip that only the most power-hungry computer users are likely to buy for at least several years. Unveiled last April, the chip crams 1.2 million transistors on a sliver of silicon, more than four times as many as on Intel 's earlier model, 80386. Intel clocks the chip 's speed at 15 million instructions per second, or MIPs. That 's four times as fast as the 386. Machines using the 486 are expected to challenge higher-priced work stations and minicomputers in applications such as so-called servers, which connect groups of computers together, and in computer-aided design. But while the chip 's speed in processing power is dazzling, it 's real strength lies in its software inheritance. The 486 is the descendant of a long series of Intel chips that began dominating the market ever since IBM picked the 16-bit 8088 chip for its first personal computer. ( A 16-bit microprocessor processes 16 pieces of data at a time and is slower than newer, 32-bit chips. ) Since then, Intel has cornered a large part of the market with successive generations of 16-bit and 32-bit chips, all of which can run software written for previous models. That 's what will keep computer makers coming in spite of the irritation of bugs. Big personal computer makers and many makers of engineering workstations are developing 486-based machines, which are expected to reach the market early next year. Of the big computer makers, only Apple Computer Co. bases its machines on Motorola chips instead. \" The 486 is going to have a big impact on the industry, \" said Hewlett - Packard 's Mr. Archuleta. \" It 's going to be the leading edge technology in personal computers for the next few years. This bug is not going to have any affect on that at all. \" Andy Zipser in Dallas contributed to this article.",

In January, American Medical brought in a new chief executive officer, Richard A. Gilleland, 45, who will remain as chairman, president and chief executive. A few days later, American Medical announced sharply lower earnings, taking charges of $ 24 million for insurance reserves and canceled real estate leases. In March, American Medical received a $ 24-a-share offer to take the company private from an investor group including large holder M. Lee Pearce. It also was considering a restructuring to help boost the stock price. A group including several members of the the Bass family of Texas urged the company to take some steps to maximize shareholder value. The following month, the company put itself up for sale. It received more offers, but the auction was surprisingly won by IMA, which bid $ 28 a share and asked Mr. Gilleland to stay on as an equity participant. He indicated that some assets might be sold off to service the debt. Then, after extending its offer four times waiting for a congressional tax ruling, IMA early this month lowered its offer to $ 26.50 a share amid turbulence in the junk bond market. American Medical accepted the offer, meanwhile indicating it had heard from two other suitors. But they never materialized and IMA completed the purchase yesterday. Other new board members include John S. Harrison and Mark A. Adley of First Boston, James F. Lyons, William S. Goldberg and Harold S. Handelsman.",

    "text": "Cie. de Navigation Mixte Chairman Marc Fournier said his board unanimously rejected as too low the $ 1.77 billion bid by Cie. Financiere de Paribas to bring its stake in Navigation Mixte to 66.7 %. At a news conference, Mr. Fournier accused Paribas of planning to pay for the takeover by selling parts of the company, whose interests include insurance, banking, tuna canning, sugar and orange juice. The chairman said his board members, including representatives of West German insurance giant Allianz AG and French banks Credit Lyonnais and Societe Generale, hold nearly 50 % of Navigation Mixte 's capital. Mr. Fournier said that as Navigation Mixte chairman, he is prohibited by takeover regulations from organizing his own defense or doing anything besides managing current company business. But sources said he will be urging his allies to boost their stakes in Navigation Mixte, which is being traded in London and is to resume trading in Paris Tuesday. At the same time, he is expected to seek legal and regulatory means of blocking or delaying Paribas 's bid. For the moment, the sources said, he has decided against seeking a white knight or organizing a counterbid for Paribas. Mr. Fournier said Navigation Mixte 's 1989 unconsolidated, or parent-company, profit is likely to be 4.7 billion francs ( $ 754.4 million ), up from 633.8 million francs last year. That is due mostly to payments from Allianz for most of the 50 % stake it has agreed to acquire in Navigation Mixte 's insurance business. Mr. Fournier said the exceptional gain would mean nearly twice as high a dividend this year as last. If holders avoid tendering to Paribas, he added, they can expect strong dividends again next year. Analysts noted that over the past 20 years, Mr. Fournier has built his company through astute stock-market activity and has warded off at least three takeover attempts. This time, however, some analysts think he could face a real battle. \" Without some unexpected \" coup de theatre \", I do n't see what will block the Paribas bid, \" said Philippe de Cholet, analyst at the brokerage Cholet - Dupont amp Cie. Mr. de Cholet said Mr. Fournier 's biggest hope was to somehow persuade regulatory authorities to block the bid. Paribas still needs the go-ahead from the Commission des Operations de Bourse, a government regulatory agency, but analysts said that is considered likely. Mr. Fournier also noted that Navigation Mixte joined Paribas 's core of shareholders when Paribas was denationalized in 1987, and said it now holds just under 5 % of Paribas 's shares. Once he realized that Paribas 's intentions were n't friendly, he said, but before the bid was launched, he sought approval to boost his Paribas stake above 10 %. The petition is still pending, but Mr. Fournier downplayed the likelihood of his organizing a takeover bid of his own for the much-larger Paribas. One big question now is the likely role of Mr. Fournier 's allies. Mr. Fournier said the large institutions that hold nearly 50 % of Navigation Mixte 's capital all strongly support him, but some analysts said they are n't so sure. Allianz, for example, has said in official comments so far that it will remain neutral. Paribas is Allianz 's lead French bank. Paribas said Monday that it intends to bid to boost its stake in Navigation Mixte to 66.7 %, from the 18.7 % it already owns. The purchase of the additional 48 % stake is expected to cost more than 11 billion francs ( $ 1.77 billion ). Paribas says it will offer 1,850 francs ( $ 296.95 ) each for Navigation Mixte shares that enjoy full dividend rights, and 1,800 francs each for a block of shares issued July 1, which will receive only partial dividends this year. Alternatively, it is to offer three Paribas shares for one Navigation Mixte share. The Paribas offer values Navigation Mixte at about 23 billion francs, depending on how many of Navigation Mixte 's warrants are converted into shares during the takeover battle.",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 39.55 points, to 2613.73, in active trading. Long-term Treasury bonds ended slightly higher. The dollar rose modestly against the mark and the yen, but soared against the pound following the resignation of Britain 's chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson. Analysts have complained that third-quarter corporate earnings have n't been very good, but the effect hit home particularly hard yesterday. Compaq Computer nose-dived $ 8.625 a share, to $ 100, and pulled other technology issues lower after reporting lower-than-expected earnings after the stock market closed Wednesday. Later yesterday the nation 's major auto makers added to the gloom when they each reported their core auto operations were net losers in the third quarter. The less-than-robust third-quarter results came amid renewed concern about the volatility of stock prices and the role of computer-aided program trading. Taken together, the worries prompted a broad sell-off of stocks. The number of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange that fell in price yesterday exceeded 1,000, a key measure of underlying sentiment among technical analysts. Although the government said the economy grew an estimated 2.5 % in the third quarter, in line with expectations, analysts are increasingly predicting much more sluggish growth -- and therefore more corporate earnings disappointments -- for the fourth quarter. \" There are a lot more downward revisions of earnings forecasts than upward revisions, \" said Abby Joseph Cohen, a market strategist at Drexel Burnham Lambert. \" People are questioning corporate profits as a pillar of support for the equity market. \" The bond market was unmoved by the economic statistics. While bond investors would have preferred growth to be a little slower, they were cheered by inflation measures in the data that showed prices rising at a modest annual rate of 2.9 %. That is another small encouragement for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in coming weeks, they reasoned. In major market activity: Stock prices fell sharply in active trading. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 175.2 million shares. Declining issues on the Big Board outstripped gainers 1,141 to 406. Bond prices were barely higher. The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year rose fractionally. Yield on the issue was 7.88 %. The dollar rose modestly against most major currencies. In late New York trading the dollar was at 1.8400 marks and 142.10 yen compared with 1.8353 marks and 141.52 yen Wednesday. The dollar soared against the pound, which was at $ 1.5765 compared with $ 1.6145 Wednesday.",

The computer maker said net jumped to $ 87 million, or $ 2.02 a share, from $ 58 million, or $ 1.40 a share, a year earlier. Sales increased 36 % to $ 683 million from $ 502 million. The latest quarter 's results, however, included a pretax gain of $ 13.7 million, or 20 cents a share, in the carrying value of the company 's investment in Conner Peripherals Inc. and a $ 7.6 million gain, or 11 cents a share, from the sale of one million Conner shares. Net for the nine months was $ 254 million, or $ 5.94 a share, up 56 % from $ 163 million, or $ 4.06 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 50 % to $ 2.1 billion from $ 1.4 billion. Net for the year-earlier nine months also included a gain of $ 9.7 million, or 15 cents a share, in the carrying value of the Conner investment. Michael Swavely, president of Compaq 's North America division, attributed the company 's third-quarter performance to continued increases in international sales, which accounted for 43 % of the company 's sales, a 74 % increase from a year earlier. \" Over the next couple of years we would not be surprised to see Europe and international { sales } represent 50 % of the company 's revenues, \" he said. During the third quarter, Compaq purchased a former Wang Laboratories manufacturing facility in Stirling, Scotland, which will be used for international service and repair operations.

    "text": "Du Pont Co. reported that third-quarter profit grew a robust 19 % from a year ago on the strength of the company 's operations in various chemicals and fibers, and in petroleum. Du Pont also raised its quarterly dividend to $ 1.20 a share from $ 1.05, a change that will increase the annualized payout to shareholders by some $ 140 million. Du Pont, unlike companies hurt badly by sharp price declines for basic chemicals and plastics, is benefiting from its broad range of businesses. The profit gain was made despite a weakening in the housing market, for which the company is a supplier, and a strengthening in the dollar, which lowers the value of overseas earnings when they are translated into dollars. The Wilmington, Del., company reported net of $ 547 million, or $ 2.36 a share, which was in line with Wall Street estimates. In the year-earlier period, the company earned $ 461 million, or $ 1.91 a share. Sales in the latest quarter were $ 8.59 billion, up 9.4 % from $ 7.85 billion. The dividend increase was Du Pont 's second this year, an affirmation of statements by top executives that they intend to increase rewards to shareholders. \" We have n't benefited the shareholder as much as we need to, \" said Edgar Woolard Jr., Du Pont 's chairman and chief executive officer, in an interview several months before he entered his current position in April. The largest beneficiary will be Seagram Co., which owns about 23 % of Du Pont. A spokesman for Seagram, the Montreal wine and spirits concern controlled by the Bronfman family, said the company will post additional pretax profit of about $ 33 million a year because of the additional Du Pont dividends. Du Pont also announced plans for a 3-for-1 stock split, although the initial higher dividend will be paid on pre-split shares. Du Pont 's stock rose $ 2.50 a share to close at $ 117.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. Seagram closed at $ 84.75, up 12.5 cents a share in Big Board trading. Leading the gains for Du Pont in the latest quarter was its industrial products segment, where profit soared to $ 155 million from $ 99 million a year earlier. The company benefited from continued strong demand and higher selling prices for titanium dioxide, a white pigment used in paints, paper and plastics. James Fallon, a New Providence, N.J., marketing consultant to the chemicals industry, says Du Pont still holds an edge in making the pigment because the company was \" first in with the technology \" to lower costs. He said Du Pont holds about 23 % of the world-wide market, the largest single share, at a time when growing uses for the pigment have kept it in tight supply, although others are now adding low-cost production capacity. Profit climbed to $ 98 million from $ 71 million in the petroleum segment, as Du Pont 's Conoco Inc. oil company was helped by crude oil prices higher than a year ago and by higher natural gas prices and volume. In the diversifed businesses segment, which includes herbicides, profit grew to $ 64 million from $ 27 million. A spokesman said herbicide use in some areas of the U.S. was delayed earlier in the year by heavy rains, thus increasing sales in the third quarter. In the fibers segment, profit rose to $ 180 million from $ 155 million, a gain Du Pont attributed to higher demand in the U.S. for most textile products. Two segments posted lower earnings for the quarter. Profit from coal fell to $ 41 million from $ 58 million, partly because of a miners ' strike. And profit from polymers dropped to $ 107 million from $ 122 million amid what Du Pont called lower demand and selling prices in certain packaging and industrial markets. For the nine months, Du Pont earned $ 2 billion, or $ 8.46 a share, up 18 % from $ 1.69 billion, or $ 7.03 a share, a year earlier. Sales increased 10 % to $ 26.54 billion from $ 24.05 billion. The increased dividend will be paid Dec. 14 to holders of record Nov. 15. The stock split, which is subject to holder approval, would be paid on a still unspecified date in January to holders of record Dec. 21.",

    "text": "H. Marshall Schwarz was named chairman and chief executive officer of U.S. Trust Corp., a private-banking firm with assets under management of about $ 17 billion. Mr. Schwarz, 52 years old, will succeed Daniel P. Davison Feb. 1, soon after Mr. Davison reaches the company 's mandatory retirement age of 65. Mr. Schwarz, who is president of U.S. Trust, will be succeeded in that post by Jeffrey S. Maurer, 42, who is executive vice president in charge of the company 's asset-management group. U.S. Trust, a 136-year-old institution that is one of the earliest high-net worth banks in the U.S., has faced intensifying competition from other firms that have established, and heavily promoted, private-banking businesses of their own. As a result, U.S. Trust 's earnings have been hurt. But Mr. Schwarz welcomes the competition in U.S. Trust 's flagship businesses, calling it \" flattery. \" Mr. Schwarz says the competition \" broadens the base of opportunity for us. \" Other firms \" are dealing with the masses. I do n't believe they have the culture \" to adequately service high-net-worth individuals, he adds. U.S. Trust recently introduced certain mutual-fund products, which allow it to serve customers with minimum deposits of $ 250,000. Previously, the company advertised at the $ 2 million level. \" We have always taken smaller accounts, but now we are looking for smaller accounts that will grow, \" Mr. Schwarz says. \" Our bread and butter is still the $ 2 million to $ 20 million account, \" he says. The new services allow U.S. Trust to cater to the \" new wealth, \" Mr. Schwarz says. Quarterly net income this year has risen just over comparable periods in 1988, when year-end net was below the 1987 level. In this year 's third quarter, for example, net was $ 10.5 million, or $ 1.05 a share, compared with $ 10.3 million, or $ 1.02 a share, a year earlier. Assets as of Sept. 30 fell to $ 2.46 billion from about $ 2.77 billion. \" We will have a reasonably flat year this year, \" Mr. Schwarz says. Mr. Schwarz also said costs associated with U.S. Trust 's planned move to midtown Manhattan from Wall Street will continue to be a drag on earnings through 1990. Mr. Schwarz 's great-grandfather founded the New York toy store F.A.O. Schwarz, but his family no longer has ties to the company. Mr. Schwarz 's father was a U.S. Trust trustee until 1974. U.S. Trust also created a four-member office of the chairman, effective Feb. 1. It will include Messrs. Schwarz and Maurer. Donald M. Roberts, 54, treasurer, and Frederick S. Wonham, 58, who takes responsibility for the funds-service group, were named vice chairmen and will serve in the office of the chairman. Mr. Roberts continues as treasurer, and Mr. Wonham remains responsible for the offices of comptroller, planning, marketing and general services. Frederick B. Taylor, 48, also was named a vice chairman and chief investment officer, a new post. He previously held similar responsibilities. Mr. Taylor also was named a director, increasing the board to 22, but is not part of the new office of the chairman. James E. Bacon, 58, executive vice president, who has directed the funds-service group, will retire.",

    "text": "Cineplex Odeon Corp. directors said the company 's chairman and chief executive, Garth Drabinsky, is considering bidding 780.6 million Canadian dollars ( US $ 666 million ) to acquire the company. The board said Mr. Drabinsky and Vice Chairman Myron Gottlieb are negotiating financing before offering C $ 16.40 a share to acquire all of Cineplex 's shares outstanding. The directors added that the two executives have n't reached a final decision to proceed with a bid and that until an offer is made the board will continue seeking higher offers from other bidders. The directors said if Messrs. Drabinsky and Gottlieb mail an offer to shareholders by Nov. 22, it will reimburse them a maximum of C $ 8.5 million for expenses related to a bid. \" We consider that his bid is an acceptable bid, \" said Sandra Kolber, spokeswoman for the independent directors ' committee appointed last May to solicit and review bids for the company in the wake of a dispute between Mr. Drabinsky and Cineplex 's major shareholder, MCA Inc. MCA and Cineplex 's other major shareholder, Montreal-based financier Charles Bronfman and his associates, have agreed to tender their holdings to an offer by Mr. Drabinsky unless a higher offer is made by another bidder. MCA holds half of Cineplex 's equity and 33 % of its voting rights through restricted voting shares, while Bronfman interests hold about 24 % of the company 's equity. Ms. Kolber said the committee had received other bids. She declined to identify other bidders but said Mr. Drabinsky 's offer \" is all cash, and it 's for all of the company. \" Several Cineplex analysts have speculated that outside bids received by the committee were either disappointingly low or for only part of the company. \" All this has really established is that MCA and the Bronfmans have agreed on a price at which they can be bought out, \" said Jeffery Logsdon, an analyst with Crowell, Weedon in Los Angeles. \" If a bid materializes at that price, shareholders will have every reason to be glad, but the question of financing still remains. \" Last April, Mr. Drabinsky and a group of financial backers planned to acquire up to 30.2 % of Cineplex for C $ 17.50 a share from Bronfman associates. Mr. Drabinsky, who would have had the right to vote those shares for two years, said the purchase, subsequently rejected by regulators, was aimed at consolidating his control of the company. MCA strongly opposed the Drabinsky group 's move. The directors did n't indicate the source of financing for Mr. Drabinsky 's new proposal, but said MCA and the Bronfman associates agreed in principle to buy for $ 57 million and then lease back to Cineplex its 18-screen theater complex in Universal City, Calif., if Mr. Drabinsky succeeds in an offer. \" This is being done at the suggestion of { Mr. Drabinsky } and to accommodate him, to facilitate his financing arrangements, \" Ms. Kolber said. In addition, the directors said if a bid by Mr. Drabinsky is successful, Cineplex expects Rank Organisation PLC to acquire the 51 % of Cineplex 's Film House unit it does n't own, and provide Mr. Drabinsky with additional loan financing. Michael Gifford, Rank 's chief executive, said the British theater chain 's total involvement \" would n't exceed $ 100 million \" but declined to give a breakdown between the loan financing and the proposed Film House purchase. Cineplex shareholders responded coolly to yesterday 's announcement. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Cineplex closed at $ 11, down 25 cents, with more than a million shares changing hands. On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Cineplex closed at C $ 12.875, off 37.5 Canadian cents, well below the C $ 16.40 level. \" Where 's the bid? \" asked Pierre Panet - Raymond, an analyst and broker with Toronto securities dealer McDermid St. Lawrence Ltd. Mr. Panet - Raymond said he does n't think Messrs. Drabinsky and Gottlieb are \" anywhere close \" to arranging financing and that investors will need a solid offer before the stock begins to rise again. Mr. Drabinsky could n't be reached for comment.",

    "text": "General Motors Corp.'s big defense and automotive electronics unit, GM Hughes Electronics, said net income fell 22 % in the third quarter, reflecting declining military spending and slumping GM vehicle production. Meanwhile, net at GM 's finance arm, General Motors Acceptance Corp., fell 3.1 %. By contrast, Electronic Data Systems Corp., GM 's data processing subsidiary, boosted net 16 %. GM closed down $ 1.875 at $ 44.875 in New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday. Earnings for GM common stock, reflecting the performance of GM 's core automotive operations, will be disclosed this morning. GM Class H, which represents a dividend interest in Hughes earnings, closed at $ 29, up 25 cents in Big Board composite trading. GM Class E, which represents a dividend interest in EDS profit, fell 75 cents to $ 52.25 on the Big Board. The earnings drop at GM Hughes Electronics is a sign of tough times at both the defense operations of Hughes Aircraft Co. and GM 's North American automotive operations, which are a primary customer for the Delco Electronics Corp. side of the GM Hughes unit. Profit at the unit fell to $ 110.6 million, or 37 cents a share, from $ 142.4 million, or 45 cents a share, largely because of a $ 24 million one-time charge associated with Hughes 's previously announced plan to reduce employment by at least 6,000 people by year end. Even excluding the charge, however, net fell 5 %. In addition, GM 's North American vehicle production fell 8.4 % from a year ago, which hurt Delco Electronic 's earnings, a company spokesman said. That decline was reflected in revenue for the GM Hughes unit, which edged down to $ 2.58 billion from $ 2.63 billion. In the nine months, GM Hughes net fell 6.6 % to $ 486.6 million, or $ 1.48 a share, from $ 521 million, or $ 1.58 a share. Revenue rose 3.5 % to $ 8.47 billion from $ 8.18 billion. At GMAC, net dropped 3.1 % to $ 234.5 million from $ 241.9 million. The finance unit attributed the decline to higher borrowing costs compared with a year earlier. GMAC said its automotive financing and leasing business rose 35 % in the U.S., largely because of dealer and customer incentives used to boost sales. GMAC profits are combined with earnings from the rest of GM 's operations and attributed to the company 's traditional common stock. In the first nine months, GMAC 's earnings fell 8 % to $ 859.5 million from $ 930.2 million. At EDS, third-quarter profit jumped 16 % to a record $ 110.9 million, or 93 cents a share, from $ 95.9 million, or 79 cents a share. Revenue rose 12 % to $ 1.37 billion from $ 1.22 billion. In the nine months, EDS earned $ 315.8 million, or $ 2.62 a share, up 13 % from $ 280.7 million, or $ 2.30 a share. Revenue rose 14 % to $ 4.03 billion from $ 3.54 billion. Revenue from non-GM accounts was 45 % of EDS 's total business in the latest nine months, compared with 40 % a year earlier. The company has said it wants to boost non-GM revenue to at least 50 % of its total business by the end of 1990.",

    "text": "Bethlehem Steel Corp., hammered by higher costs and lower shipments to key automotive and service-center customers, posted a 54 % drop in third-quarter profit. Separately, two more of the nation 's top steelmakers -- Armco Inc. and National Intergroup Inc. -- reported lower operating earnings in their steel businesses, marking what is generally believed to be the end of a two-year boom in the industry. Wall Street analysts expect the disappointing trend to continue into the fourth quarter and through at least the first two quarters of 1990, when the industry will increasingly see the effect of price erosion in major product lines, such as rolled sheet used for cars, appliances and construction. \" It does n't bode well for coming quarters, \" said John Jacobson, who follows the steel industry for AUS Consultants. In fact, he thinks several steelmakers will report actual losses through the third quarter of 1990. Bethlehem, the nation 's second largest steelmaker, earned $ 46.9 million, or 54 cents a share. The figures include $ 15 million in costs related to a blast furnace outage and $ 8 million in losses from unauthorized work outages at the company 's coal operations. In the year-ago period, Bethlehem earned $ 101.4 million, or $ 1.27 a share, including a $ 3.8 million gain from early retirement of debt. Third-quarter sales dropped 11 % to $ 1.27 billion from $ 1.43 billion a year ago. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Bethlehem shares rose 50 cents to $ 17.375. Of all the major steelmakers, Bethlehem would seem to be the most vulnerable to a slowdown. It has n't diversified beyond steel, nor has it linked up with a joint venture partner to share costs and risks. However, in spite of the difficult industrywide environment of high cost and low volume, Bethlehem \" had pretty good earnings numbers, \" said Michelle Galanter Applebaum, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. Ms. Applebaum had estimated third-quarter earnings of 55 cents a shhha55 cents a share, ents a share, but ssa share, but said the losses for the unusual items were larger than expected. Still, Bethlehem 's core basic steel operations experienced a steep drop in operating profit to $ 58.6 million from $ 186.4 million a year ago, when the industry enjoyed strong demand and pricing. The company said its shipments declined as a result of a reduction in inventories by service centers, a lackluster automotive market and increasing competitive pressures in the construction market. At the same time, production costs, compared with a year ago, were boosted by higher raw material and employment costs, which resulted from the company 's new labor pact effective June 1. \" We anticipate that steel market conditions will exhibit a further moderate decline in the fourth quarter as the automotive sector remains weak and customers continue to adjust inventories, \" said Bethlehem Chairman Walter F. Williams. He noted, however, that the company 's order entry has increased from the low levels of the early summer, following the end of labor negotiations. Steel business, said third-quarter net income dropped 8 % to $ 33 million, or 35 cents a share, from $ 36 million, or 39 cents a share in the year-ago quarter. Sales dropped to $ 441.1 million from $ 820.4 million, because the company no longer consolidates its Eastern Steel division, which is now a joint venture with Kawasaki Steel Corp. Along with reduced volume, analysts said the nation 's fifth largest steelmaker was hurt by holding higher-cost inventory when raw material costs of such key products as nickel dropped. Operating profit dropped 46 % in its specialty flat-rolled steel segment. Moreover, the company said higher sales and shipments to service centers from its Armco Steel Co. joint venture failed to offset weakness in the automotive market, higher production costs and a poorer product mix. Armco shares closed unchanged at $ 10.625 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. National Intergroup, which owns 50 % of the nation 's sixth largest steelmaker -- National Steel Corp. -- posted net income for the fiscal second-quarter of $ 8.6 million, or 33 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $ 50.3 million. Sales increased in the quarter ended Sept. 30 to $ 747.8 million from $ 623.5 million a year ago. The latest period includes gains of $ 9.1 million from early retirement of debt and tax loss carry-forward. Last year 's results were hurt by $ 41.3 million in restructuring charges. National Intergroup stock closed at $ 15, unchanged in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company noted that its Fox - Meyer Drug Co., Ben Franklin Stores Inc. and Permian Corp. operations showed improvements as a result of restructuring moves. However, its equity in the net income of National Steel declined to $ 6.3 million from $ 10.9 million as a result of softer demand and lost orders following prolonged labor talks and a threatened strike. National Intergroup is negotiating for the sale of its 50 % interest in National Steel to concentrate more fully on drug distribution operations.",

    "text": "In a stunning shift in direction, Provigo Inc. said it will sell all its non-food operations to concentrate solely on its retail and wholesale grocery business. The non-food operations accounted for about 27 % of Provigo 's 7.38 billion Canadian dollars ( US $ 6.3 billion ) in sales in the latest fiscal year. In a related move, Pierre Lortie, chairman and chief executive, resigned. Mr. Lortie joined Provigo in 1985 and spearheaded the company 's drive to grow outside its traditional food business. He could n't be reached for comment. Bertin Nadeau, newly appointed chairman and interim chief executive of Provigo, would n't say if Mr. Lortie was asked to leave. \" Mr. Lortie felt less pertinent, \" Mr. Nadeau said, given the decision to dump Provigo 's non-food operations. \" At this stage it was felt I was perhaps more pertinent as chief executive. \" Mr. Nadeau also is chairman and chief executive of Unigesco Inc., Provigo 's controlling shareholder. At a news conference, Mr. Nadeau said the sale of the three non-food businesses, which account for nearly half the company 's C $ 900 million in assets, should be completed in a \" matter of months. \" The three units are a nationwide pharmaceutical and health-products distributor, a small sporting-goods chain, and a combination catalog showroom and toy-store chain. Investors and analysts applauded the news. Provigo was the most active industrial stock on the Montreal Exchange, where it closed at C $ 9.75 ( US $ 8.32 ), up 75 Canadian cents. \" I think it 's a pretty positive development, \" said Ross Cowan, a financial analyst with Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc., of the decision to concentrate on groceries. Mr. Lortie 's departure, while sudden, was seen as inevitable in light of the shift in strategy. \" The non-food operations were largely Mr. Lortie 's creation { and } his strategy did n't work, \" said Steven Holt, a financial analyst with Midland Doherty Ltd. Provigo 's profit record over the past two years tarnished the company 's and Mr. Lortie 's reputations. For the six months ended Aug. 12, Provigo posted net income of C $ 6.5 million, or eight Canadian cents a share, compared with C $ 18.1 million, or 21 Canadian cents a share, a year earlier. Sales were C $ 4.2 billion compared with C $ 3.7 billion. Last month, Canadian Bond Rating Service downgraded Provigo 's commercial paper and debentures because of its lackluster performance. Analysts are skeptical Provigo will be able to sell the non-food businesses as a group for at least book value, and are expecting write-downs. Mr. Nadeau said he could n't yet say if the sale prices would match book values. He said all three non-food operations are profitable. Mr. Nadeau said discussions are under way with potential purchasers of each of the units. He declined to confirm or deny reports that Provigo executive Henri Roy is trying to put together a management buy-out of the catalogue showroom unit. Mr. Roy could n't be reached. Yvon Bussieres was named senior executive vice president and chief operating officer of Provigo, a new position. Mr. Bussieres was president and chief operating officer of Provigo 's Quebec retail and wholesale grocery unit. Mr. Nadeau said he intends to remain Provigo 's chief executive only until the non-food businesses are sold, after a which a new chief executive will be named.",

The Atlanta-based airline, the third largest in the U.S., attributed the increase to higher passenger traffic, new international routes and reduced service by rival Eastern Airlines, which is in bankruptcy proceedings in the wake of a strike that began last spring. For the quarter ended Sept. 30, Delta posted net income of $ 133.1 million, or $ 2.53 a share, up from $ 100 million, or $ 2.03 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 15 % to $ 2.17 billion from $ 1.89 billion. During the quarter, Delta issued 2.5 million shares of common stock to Swissair, and repurchased 1.1 million shares for use in a company employee stock ownership plan. \" The key to Delta 's record earnings continued to be excellent passenger revenue growth, \" said Thomas Roeck, chief financial officer. Passenger traffic jumped 14 % in the quarter, while profit per passenger grew 2 %. Delta has benefited more than other carriers from the weakness of Eastern Airlines, which shares the Atlanta hub. Although Eastern is back to about 80 % of its pre-strike schedule now, the Texas Air Corp. subsidiary was only beginning to get back on its feet during the quarter. Separately, America West Airlines, Phoenix, Ariz., reported third-quarter profit jumped 45 % to $ 5.8 million, or 28 cents a share, from $ 4 million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier.

    "text": "Columbia Savings amp Loan Association, reeling from thrift-accounting changes mandated by Congress and the recent collapse of the junk-bond market, announced a loss for the third quarter of $ 226.3 million, or $ 11.57 a share. For the quarter a year ago, Columbia reported earnings of $ 16.3 million, or 37 cents a share. Total assets increased to $ 12.7 billion in the latest quarter from $ 12.4 billion a year earlier. The loss stems from $ 357.5 million of write-downs on Columbia 's $ 4.4 billion high-yield investment securities portfolio, which includes about $ 3.7 billion of junk bonds, $ 400 million of preferred stock, and Treasury securities. Columbia owes its spectacular growth in recent years to its junk-bond portfolio, the largest of any U.S. thrift. Much of Columbia 's junk-bond trading has been done through the high-yield department of its Beverly Hills neighbor, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. For the nine months, losses totaled $ 212 million, or $ 10.83 a share, compared with net income of $ 48.7 million, or $ 1.11 a share, a year earlier. The results include a $ 130.2 million write-down of the securities in the high-yield portfolio to the lower of their cost or market value. Columbia also added $ 227.3 million to reserves for losses on the portfolio, increasing general reserves to $ 300 million, or about 6.7 % of the total portfolio, as of Sept. 30. On June 30, loss reserves stood at $ 108.3 million. Thrift officials said the $ 300 million reserve will be adjusted quarterly and will reflect the rate of dispositions and market conditions. The adjustments result from the recently passed thrift-industry bailout legislation, which requires thrifts to divest all high-yield bond investments by 1994. Previously, Columbia did n't have to adjust the book value of its junk-bond holdings to reflect declines in market prices, because it held the bonds as long-term investments. Because Columbia now must sell the bonds within five years, accounting rules require the thrift to value the bonds at the lower of cost or market prices. For its future strategy, Columbia officials said the thrift may branch out into commercial lending or managing outside investments, as well as beefing up more traditional thrift activities. The quarterly results also reflected $ 21.4 million in non-recurring losses from commercial real-estate activities in California. Thomas Spiegel, Columbia 's chairman, said in a statement that the thrift was \" disappointed \" by the effects of the accounting changes. But he said Columbia remains \" one of the most strongly capitalized thrifts in the industry, \" based on the economic value of its assets and tangible capital. Columbia announced the results after the close of the stock market. Its shares closed at $ 5.125 each in composite New York Stock Exchange trading, down 37.5 cents. The price of Columbia shares has been cut nearly in half since August, when they traded at about $ 10, as investors apparently realized that the thrift would be forced to take a big write-down. The stock 's decline accelerated in the past two weeks, from a price of $ 8 a share on Oct. 9. Columbia officials said they do n't know how quickly they will dispose of the thrift 's junk bonds, because federal regulations, such as those that would allow thrifts to continue holding the bonds in separately capitalized subsidiaries, have n't yet been completed. Columbia officials also said the thrift should n't face problems meeting regulatory capital requirements, despite the large reserves and write-downs and stiffer regulatory requirements that should be in place by year 's end. Its ratio of tangible equity to total assets as of Sept. 30 was 3.6 %, and total equity was $ 457.9 million. The thrift emphasized that it has a large portfolio of equity securities issued in connection with corporate restructurings and leveraged buy-outs, which has a book value of $ 90 million. Although many of the transactions related to those securities have n't been completed, Columbia said the ultimate gain on the sale of those assets will range from $ 200 million to $ 300 million. Columbia also has unrealized gains in its public equity securities portfolio of more than $ 70 million. David B. Hilder in New York contributed to this article.",

    "text": "Anheuser - Busch Cos. said it plans to aggressively discount its major beer brands, setting the stage for a potentially bruising price war as the maturing industry 's growth continues to slow. Anheuser, the world 's largest brewer and U.S. market leader, has historically been reluctant to engage in price-cutting as a means of boosting sales volume. With the passing of the heady days of swelling industry sales, however, the once-sporadic and brief forays into discounting are becoming standard competitive weapons in the beer industry. Over the summer, Anheuser competitors offered more and deeper discounts than industry observers have seen for a long time. Some experts now predict Anheuser 's entry into the fray means near-term earnings trouble for all the industry players. The St. Louis company said major rivals, Philip Morris Co.'s Miller Brewing unit and Adolph Coors Co. \" have been following a policy of continuous and deep discounting for at least the past 18 months \" on their premium brands, pricing their product as much as 25 cents a 12-pack below Anheuser 's Budweiser label in many markets. Anheuser said it 's discounting policy basically would involve matching such moves by rivals on a market-by-market basis. Anheuser - Busch announced its plan at the same time it reported third-quarter net income rose a lower-than-anticipated 5.2 % to $ 238.3 million, or 83 cents a share, from $ 226.5 million, or 78 cents. Third-period sales were $ 2.49 billion, up from last year 's $ 2.34 billion. Anheuser said its new strategy -- started in some markets last month and expected to be applied soon in selected markets nationwide -- will mean lower-than-anticipated earnings for the last half of 1989 and for 1990. The projection sent Anheuser shares plunging $ 4.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. The stock closed at $ 38.50 on heavy volume of about 3.5 million shares. Shares of Coors, the company 's sole publicly traded major competitor, fell $ 1.50 apiece to $ 19.125 in national over-the-counter trading, apparently on investor concerns over potential fallout from the coming pricing struggle. Anheuser noted that \" beer industry sales volume is 1989 is following the trend that has characterized the last half of the ' 80s, with sales volume being essentially flat \" while consolidation creates fewer, bigger players. \" We can not permit a further slowing in our volume trend, \" Anheuser said, adding it will take \" appropriate competitive pricing actions to support our long-term market share growth strategy \" for the premium brands. Anheuser said it continues to hold to its earlier-announced goal of a 50 % U.S. market share by the mid-1990s. Beneath the tepid news-release jargon lies a powerful threat from the brewing giant, which last year accounted for about 41 % of all U.S. beer sales and is expected to see that grow to 42.5 % in the current year. \" Anheuser is the biggest guy in the bar, and he just decided to join in the barroom brawl, \" said Joseph J. Doyle, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham amp Co. \" It 's going to get bloody. \" Jerry Steinman, publisher of Beer Marketers Insights, a trade newsletter, said Anheuser 's announcement means \" everybody else in the industry is going to have a difficult time reaching their profit objectives. \" Prudential - Bache Securities Inc. analyst George E. Thompson downplayed the importance of the announcement, and called any comparison between the coming beer-industry tiff and the seemingly unending \" cola wars, \" unwarranted. Mr. Thompson calls discounting \" a loser 's game for anyone without a dominant market share, \" and projected that Anheuser 's statement of intent could simply be a means of warning competitors to ease up on price-cutting or face a costly and fruitless battle. Mr. Thompson noted that the disappointing earnings, which fell five cents a share short of his own projections, contributed to the sell-off by an edgy and currently unforgiving investing public. But Smith Barney 's Mr. Doyle, who yesterday trimmed his 1990 Anheuser earnings projection to $ 2.95 a share from $ 3.10, called the market 's reaction \" justified. \" While the third-quarter earnings were a \" moderate disappointment, \" he said, \" the real bad news is the intensity of price competition \" in the premium-beer sector. According to Mr. Steinman, the newsletter publisher, Anheuser 's market share is nearly twice that of its nearest competitor, Miller Brewing, which had a 21.2 % stake last year. It 's followed by Stroh Brewery Co., which has agreed to sell its assets to Coors. Both Coors and Stroh have recently been ceding market share to Miller and Anheuser.",

In the aforementioned subsegment, the fall in transport, clothing and healthcare products stands out, with, in contrast, an increase in medical services. The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), which measures the trend in prices using the same method in all countries of the Eurozone, also ended the year at 1.2%. The National Institute of Statistics (NIS) confirmed that the figure for the decrease in inflation at the end of the year was a result of the reduction in fuel prices, especially diesel and petrol, which consequently led to the containment of inflation in all products and services, with transportation implications. In contrast, products associated with leisure and culture increased their prices the most in the final third of the year, driven by the rise in tourism package prices. In December 2018, the highest year-on-year inflation was recorded in the Canary Islands, Catalonia and Madrid (all at 1.4%), as well as Navarre, which also ended the year above the Spanish average (1.3%). Only Melilla ended the year Furthermore, consumer confidence in Spain ended the year at 90.9 points (negative confidence), which was the lowest level in the last two years (consumer perception must be above 100 points in order to be considered positive).
