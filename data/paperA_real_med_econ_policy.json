    "text": "Gastrointestinal Consequences of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Impaired Glycemic Homeostasis A Mendelian Randomization Study.. We conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) study to examine the associations of type 2 diabetes and glycemic traits with gastrointestinal diseases (GDs). Uncorrelated genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes (n 231), fasting insulin (n 38), fasting glucose (n 71), and hemoglobin A1c (n 75) at the genome-wide significance were selected as instrument variables. Genetic associations with 23 common GDs were obtained from the FinnGen and UK Biobank studies and other large consortia. Genetic liability to type 2 diabetes was associated with the risk of 12 GDs. Per 1-unit increase in the log-transformed odds ratio (OR) of type 2 diabetes, the OR was 1.06 (95% CI, 1.03-1.09) for gastroesophageal reflux disease, 1.12 (95% CI, 1.07-1.17) for gastric ulcer, 1.11 (95% CI, 1.03-1.20) for acute gastritis, 1.07 (95% CI, 1.01-1.13) for chronic gastritis, 1.08 (95% CI, 1.03-1.12) for irritable bowel syndrome, 1.04 (95% CI, 1.01-1.07) for diverticular disease, 1.08 (95% CI, 1.02-1.14) for acute pancreatitis, 1.09 (95% CI, 1.05-1.12) for cholelithiasis, 1.09 (95% CI, 1.05-1.13) for cholelithiasis with cholecystitis, 1.29 (95% CI, 1.17-1.43) for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, 1.12 (95% CI, 1.03-1.21) for liver cirrhosis, and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89-0.97) for ulcerative colitis. Genetically predicted higher levels of fasting insulin and glucose were associated with six and one GDs, respectively. Associations were found between genetic liability to type 2 diabetes and an increased risk of a broad range of GDs, highlighting the importance of GD prevention in patients with type 2 diabetes.",

Advances in wound treatment depend on the availability of animal models that reflect key aspects of human wound healing physiology. To this date, the accepted mouse models do not reflect defects in the healing process for chronic wounds that are associated with type two diabetic skin ulcers. The long term, systemic physiologic stress that occurs in middle aged or older Type 2 diabetes patients is difficult to simulate in preclinical animal model. We have strived to incorporate the essential elements of this stress in a manageable mouse model long term metabolic stress from obesity to include the effects of middle age and thereafter onset of diabetes. At six-weeks age, male C57BL6 mice were separated into groups fed a chow and High-Fat Diet for 0.5, 3, and 6 months. Treatment groups included long term, obesity stressed mice with induction of diabetes by streptozotocin at 5 months, and further physiologic evaluation at 8 months old. We show that this model results in a severe metabolic phenotype with insulin resistance and glucose intolerance associated with obesity and, more importantly, skin changes. The phenotype of this older age mouse model included a transcriptional signature of gene expression in skin that overlapped that observed with elderly patients who develop diabetic foot ulcers. We believe this unique old age phenotype contrasts with current mice models with induced diabetes.",

Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDPs) are major causes of maternal and fetal morbidity and are observationally associated with future maternal risk of cardiovascular disease. However, observational results may be subject to residual confounding and bias. To investigate the association of HDPs with multiple cardiovascular diseases. A genome-wide genetic association study using mendelian randomization (MR) was performed from February 16 to March 4, 2022. Primary analysis was conducted using inverse-variance-weighted MR. Mediation analyses were performed using a multivariable MR framework. All studies included patients predominantly of European ancestry. Female-specific summary-level data from FinnGen (sixth release). Uncorrelated (r2<0.001) single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were selected as instrumental variants from the FinnGen consortium summary statistics for exposures of any HDP, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia or eclampsia. Genetic association estimates for outcomes were extracted from genome-wide association studies of 122 733 cases for coronary artery disease, 34 217 cases for ischemic stroke, 47 309 cases for heart failure, and 60 620 cases for atrial fibrillation. Genetically predicted HDPs were associated with a higher risk of coronary artery disease (odds ratio OR, 1.24 95% CI, 1.08-1.43 P .002) this association was evident for both gestational hypertension (OR, 1.08 95% CI, 1.00-1.17 P .04) and preeclampsiaeclampsia (OR, 1.06 95% CI, 1.01-1.12 P .03). Genetically predicted HDPs were also associated with a higher risk of ischemic stroke (OR, 1.27 95% CI, 1.12-1.44 P 2.87 \u00d7 10-4). Mediation analysis revealed a partial attenuation of the effect of HDPs on coronary artery disease after adjustment for systolic blood pressure (total effect OR, 1.24 direct effect OR, 1.10 95% CI, 1.02-1.08 P .02) and type 2 diabetes (total effect OR, 1.24 direct effect OR, 1.16 95% CI, 1.04-1.29 P .008). No associations were noted between genetically predicted HDPs and heart failure (OR, 0.97 95% CI, 0.76-1.23 P .79) or atrial fibrillation (OR, 1.11 95% CI, 0.65-1.88 P .71). The findings of this study provide genetic evidence supporting an association between HDPs and higher risk of coronary artery disease and stroke, which is only partially mediated by cardiometabolic factors. This supports classification of HDPs as risk factors for cardiovascular disease.",

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the landscape of modern medicine on a global scale. An emerging concern is the recognition of a bidirectional relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes. Diabetes is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness. Intriguingly, recent epidemiological and This review provides an overview of our current understanding of the incidence and prevalence of diabetes in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, highlights studies evaluating SARS-CoV-2s beta cell tropism and its effects on insulin secretion and sensitivity and evaluates the impact of the pandemic on diabetes management and metabolic control. Epidemiological studies have noted an increase in the incidence of new-onset diabetes associated with COVID-19 in patients with phenotypes of type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes and Ketosis-Prone Diabetes. Prospective studies are needed to fully elucidate the association between COVID-19 and diabetes and to characterize persons at risk of developing diabetes after SARS-CoV-2 infection, identify those who should be screened for diabetes, and determine the natural histories of different forms of diabetes associated with COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected medical care worldwide. Healthcare systems have been overwhelmed during \u2018surges\u2019 of COVID-19 illness, and access to care has been affected during prolonged lockdowns. COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is highly contagious. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can lead to serious illness, primarily in the lungs, but it often affects many other organ systems, leading to disability and death. Recent studies show that persons with diabetes can have a more severe course of illness if infected with SARS-CoV-2. There is also growing evidence that COVID-19 may cause diabetes or worsen preexisting diabetes. In this review, we discuss the findings of studies that show an increase in the frequency of diabetes diagnosed worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also examine recent data that suggest SARS-CoV-2 can infect and damage the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Finally, we provide an overview of the impact of COVID-19 on the management of patients with diabetes, and the emerging use of telemedicine in diabetes care.",

The extracellular matrix (ECM) is fundamental for the normal endocrine functions of pancreatic islet cells and plays key roles in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. Here we investigated the turnover of islet ECM components, including islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), in an obese mouse model treated with semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide type 1 receptor agonist. Male one-month-old C57BL6 mice were fed a control diet (C) or a high-fat diet (HF) for 16 weeks, then treated with semaglutide (subcutaneous 40 \u03bcgkg every three days) for an additional four weeks (HFS). The islets were immunostained and gene expressions were assessed. Comparisons refer to HFS vs HF. Thus, IAPP immunolabeling and beta-cell-enriched beta-amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (Bace2, -40 %) and heparanase immunolabeling and gene (Hpse, -40 %) were mitigated by semaglutide. In contrast, perlecan (Hspg2, 900 %) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa, 420 %) were enhanced by semaglutide. Also, semaglutide lessened syndecan 4 (Sdc4, -65 %) and hyaluronan synthases (Has1, -45 % Has2, -65 %) as well as chondroitin sulfate immunolabeling, and collagen type 1 (Col1a1, -60 %) and type 6 (Col6a3, -15 %), lysyl oxidase (Lox, -30 %) and metalloproteinases (Mmp2, -45 % Mmp9, -60 %). Semaglutide improved the turnover of islet heparan sulfate proteoglycans, hyaluronan, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, and collagens in the islet ECM. Such changes should contribute to restoring a healthy islet functional milieu and should reduce the formation of cell-damaging amyloid deposits. Our findings also provide additional evidence for the involvement of islet proteoglycans in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes.",

The drug pair DG was designed by Dr. Zhu chenyu to improve the treatment of T2DM. This study combined with systematic pharmacology and urine metabonomics to explore the mechanism of DG in the treatment of T2DM. The therapeutic effect of DG on T2DM was evaluated by fasting blood glucose (FBG) and biochemical indexes. Systematic pharmacology was used to screen the active components and targets that may be related to DG. Metabonomics was established to find urinary metabolites and pathways that may be induced by DG. Finally, integrate the results of these two parts for mutual verification. FBG and biochemical indexes showed that DG could reduce FBG and adjust the related biochemical indexes. Metabolomics analysis indicated that 39 metabolites were related to DG for T2DM treatment. In addition, systematic pharmacology showed compounds and potential targets which were associated with DG. Finally, 12 promising targets were selected as targets for T2DM therapy by integrating the results. The combination of metabonomics and systematic pharmacology based on LC-MS is feasible and effective, which provides strong support for exploring the effective components and pharmacological mechanism of TCM.",

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) affects millions of people worldwide and is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. The skeletal muscle (SKM) is one of the most important tissues involved in maintaining glucose homeostasis and substrate oxidation, and it undergoes insulin resistance in T2D. In this study, we identify the existence of alterations in the expression of mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (mt-aaRSs) in skeletal muscle from two different forms of T2D early-onset type 2 diabetes (YT2) (onset of the disease before 30 years of age) and the classical form of the disease (OT2). GSEA analysis from microarray studies revealed the repression of mitochondrial mt-aaRSs independently of age, which was validated by real-time PCR assays. In agreement with this, a reduced expression of several encoding mt-aaRSs was also detected in skeletal muscle from diabetic (dbdb) mice but not in obese obob mice. In addition, the expression of the mt-aaRSs proteins most relevant in the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins, threonyl-tRNA, and leucyl-tRNA synthetases (TARS2 and LARS2) were also repressed in muscle from dbdb mice. It is likely that these alterations participate in the reduced expression of proteins synthesized in the mitochondria detected in dbdb mice. We also document an increased iNOS abundance in mitochondrial-enriched muscle fractions from diabetic mice that may inhibit aminoacylation of TARS2 and LARS2 by nitrosative stress. Our results indicate a reduced expression of mt-aaRSs in skeletal muscle from T2D patients, which may participate in the reduced expression of proteins synthesized in mitochondria. An enhanced mitochondrial iNOS could play a regulatory role in diabetes.",

In integrated healthcare systems in Colorado, Oregon, and Washington, we identified a cohort of adults on February 29, 2020 (n 1,086,918) and conducted follow-up through February 28, 2021. Electronic health data and death certificates were used to identify markers of diabetes severity, covariates, and outcomes. Outcomes were COVID-19 infection (positive nucleic acid antigen test, COVID-19 hospitalization, or COVID-19 death) and severe COVID-19 (invasive mechanical ventilation or COVID-19 death). Individuals with diabetes (n 142,340) and categories of diabetes severity measures were compared with a referent group with no diabetes (n 944,578), adjusting for demographic variables, neighborhood deprivation index, body mass index, and comorbidities.

Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) is an autosomal dominant condition and represents 1-5% of all cases of diabetes mellitus. MODY is often misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The rare subtype 5 (HNF1B-MODY) is due to hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u03b2 (HNF1B) molecular alteration and is remarkable for its multisystemic phenotypes characterized by a broad spectrum of pancreatic and extra-pancreatic clinical manifestations. Retrospective study of patients with HNF1B-MODY diagnosis followed in the Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00e1rio Lisboa Central (Lisbon, Portugal). Demographic data, medical history, clinical and laboratory data, follow-up and treatment procedures were obtained from electronic medical records. We found 10 patients with HNF1B variants (7 index cases). The median age at diabetes diagnosis was 28 (IQR 24) years and the median age at HNF1B-MODY diagnosis was 40.5 (IQR 23) years. Six patients were initially misclassified as type 1 and 4 as type 2 diabetes. The average time between diabetes diagnosis and the diagnosis of HNF1B-MODY was 16.5 years. Diabetes was the first manifestation in half of the cases. The other half presented with kidney malformations and chronic kidney disease at pediatric age as the first manifestation. All these patients were submitted to kidney transplantation. Long-term diabetes complications included retinopathy (410), peripheral neuropathy (210) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (110). Other extra-pancreatic manifestations included liver test alterations (410) and congenital malformation of the female reproductive tract (16).

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a common diagnosis in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). The prevalence of LVH among patients with Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), high blood pressure and aging is higher than the healthy population and has been independently associated with an increased risk for future cardiac event, including stroke. The aim of this study is to identify the prevalence of LVH among T2DM subjects and evaluate its association with related risk factors of CVD patients in the metropolis of Shiraz, Iran. The novelty of this study is that there has been no known published epidemiological study related to the relationship of LVH and T2DM on this unique population. This cross-sectional study was designed based on collected data of 7715 free dwelling subjects in the community-based Shiraz Cohort Heart Study (SCHS) from 2015 to 2021, ages 40-70 years. Overall, 1118 subjects with T2DM were identified in the SCHS and after exclusion criteria, 595 subjects remained eligible for study. Subjects with electrocardiography (ECG) results, which are appropriate and diagnostics tools, were evaluated for the presence of LVH. Thus, the variables related to LVH and non-LVH in subjects with diabetes were analyzed using version-22 statistical package for social sciences software program to ensure consistency, accuracy, reliability, and validity for final analysis. Based upon related variables and identifying LVH and non-LVH subjects, the relevant statistical analysis was implemented to ensure its consistency, accuracy, reliability, and validity for final analysis. Overall, the prevalence of diabetic subjects was 14.5% in the SCHS study. Furthermore, the prevalence of hypertension in the study subjects aged 40-70 years was 37.8%. The prevalence of hypertension history in T2DM study subjects for LVH compared to non-LVH was (53.7% vs. 33.7%).

Analytical findings comparing both LVH and non-LVH subjects who have T2DM identified significance for variables in the older (\u2265 60) mean and categorical age group (P < 0.0001), history of hypertension (P < 0.0001), mean and categorical duration of hypertension in years (P < 0.0160), status of controlled versus uncontrolled hypertension level (P < 0.0120), the mean systolic blood pressure (P < 0.0001) as well as mean duration years of T2DM and categorical duration of diabetes in years (< 0.0001 and P < 0.0060), mean fasting blood sugar (< 0.0307) and categorical status of FBS Level (mgdl) controlled and uncontrolled FBS status of controlled vs. uncontrolled FBS levels P < 0.0020). However, there were no significant findings for gender (P 0.3112), diastolic blood pressure mean (P 0.7722) and body mass index (BMI) mean and categorical BMI (P 0.2888 and P 0.4080, respectively). The prevalence of LVH in the study increases significantly among T2DM patients with hypertension, older age, years of hypertension, years of diabetes, and higher FBS. Thus, given the significant risk of diabetes and CVD, evaluation of LVH through reasonable diagnostic testing with ECG can help reduce the risk of future complications through the development of risk factor modifications and treatments guidelines.",

Hypoglycaemia due to fasting during Ramadan may affect the ability to perform complex activities among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), but it is unclear how this affects ones ability to drive. This study aims to explore driving experiences and coping strategies to ensure safe driving among people with T2D who fast during Ramadan. We conducted an exploratory qualitative study and purposefully selected people with T2D who drove and fasted during the past Ramadan period in 2019. In-depth face-to-face interviews were conducted and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed thematically using a constant comparative method until saturation was achieved (n 16). Two major themes were identified, namely (1) knowing oneself and (2) voluntary self-restriction. Participants described the importance of understanding how Ramadan fasting affected them and their level of alertness. As such, participants often adjusted their daily activities and tested their blood glucose levels to prevent experiencing hypoglycaemia. Other coping strategies reported include adjusting their medications and driving restrictions or driving in the mornings when they were more alert. Findings from this study shed light on participants experiences and coping mechanisms while driving during Ramadan. Given the risks and effects of hypoglycaemia among those who fast, there is a need to provide appropriate and focused patient education during Ramadan to people with T2D to ensure they can perform complex activities such as driving safely, especially in Muslim majority countries.",

Although insulin resistance often leads to type 2 diabetes mellitus, its early stages are often unrecognised, thus reducing the probability of successful prevention and intervention. Moreover, treatment efficacy is affected by the genetics of the individual. We used gene expression profiles from a cross-sectional study to identify potential candidate genes for the prediction of diabetes risk and intervention response. Using a multivariate regression model, we linked gene expression profiles of human skeletal muscle and intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) to fasting glucose levels and glucose infusion rate. Based on the expression patterns of the top predictive genes, we characterised and compared individual gene expression with clinical classifications using k-nearest neighbour clustering. The predictive potential of the candidate genes identified was validated using muscle gene expression data from a longitudinal intervention study. We found that genes with a strong association with clinical measures clustered into three distinct expression patterns. Their predictive values for insulin resistance varied substantially between skeletal muscle and IMAT. Moreover, we discovered that individual gene expression-based classifications may differ from classifications based predominantly on clinical variables, indicating that participant stratification may be imprecise if only clinical variables are used for classification. Of the 15 top candidate genes, ST3GAL2, AASS, ARF1 and the transcription factor SIN3A are novel candidates for predicting a refined diabetes risk and intervention response. Our results confirm that disease progression and successful intervention depend on individual gene expression states. We anticipate that our findings may lead to a better understanding and prediction of individual diabetes risk and may help to develop individualised intervention strategies.",

    "text": "Antenatal dietary supplementation with myo-inositol for preventing gestational diabetes.. Gestational diabetes with onset or first recognition during pregnancy is an increasing problem worldwide. Myo-inositol, an isomer of inositol, is a naturally occurring sugar commonly found in cereals, corn, legumes and meat. Myo-inositol is one of the intracellular mediators of the insulin signal and correlates with insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes. The potential beneficial effect of improving insulin sensitivity suggests that myo-inositol may be useful for women in preventing gestational diabetes. This is an update of a review first published in 2015. To assess if antenatal dietary supplementation with myo-inositol is safe and effective, for the mother and fetus, in preventing gestational diabetes. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirths Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP (17 March 2022) and the reference lists of retrieved studies. We included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including cluster-RCTs and conference abstracts, assessing the effects of myo-inositol for the prevention of gestational diabetes in pregnant women. We included studies that compared any dose of myo-inositol, alone or in a combination preparation, with no treatment, placebo or another intervention. Quasi-randomised and cross-over trials were not eligible. We excluded women with pre-existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted the data. We checked the data for accuracy. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We included seven RCTs (one conducted in Ireland, six conducted in Italy) reporting on 1319 women who were 10 weeks to 24 weeks pregnant at the start of the studies. The studies had relatively small sample sizes and the overall risk of bias was low. For the primary maternal outcomes, meta-analysis showed that myo-inositol may reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes (risk ratio (RR) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 0.90 6 studies, 1140 women) and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.61 5 studies, 1052 women). However, the certainty of the evidence was low to very low. For the primary neonatal outcomes, only one study measured the risk of a large-for-gestational-age infant and found myo-inositol was associated with both appreciable benefit and harm (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.65 to 3.02 1 study, 234 infants low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported on the other primary neonatal outcomes (perinatal mortality, mortality or morbidity composite). For the secondary maternal outcomes, we are unclear about the effect of myo-inositol on weight gain during pregnancy (mean difference (MD) -0.25 kilogram (kg), 95% CI -1.26 to 0.75 kg 4 studies, 831 women) and perineal trauma (RR 4.0, 95% CI 0.45 to 35.25 1 study, 234 women) because the evidence was assessed as being very low-certainty. Further, myo-inositol may result in little to no difference in caesarean section (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.07 4 studies, 829 women low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported on the other secondary maternal outcomes (postnatal depression and the development of subsequent type 2 diabetes mellitus). For the secondary neonatal outcomes, meta-analysis showed no neonatal hypoglycaemia (RR 3.07, 95% CI 0.90 to 10.52 4 studies 671 infants very low-certainty evidence). However, myo-inositol may be associated with a reduction in the incidence of preterm birth (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.70 4 studies 829 infants). There were insufficient data for a number of maternal and neonatal secondary outcomes, and no data were reported for any of the long-term childhood or adulthood outcomes, or for health service utilisation outcomes. Evidence from seven studies shows that antenatal dietary supplementation with myo-inositol during pregnancy may reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and preterm birth. Limited data suggest that supplementation with myo-inositol may not reduce the risk of a large-for-gestational-age infant. The current evidence is based on small studies that were not powered to detect differences in outcomes such as perinatal mortality and serious infant morbidity. Six of the included studies were conducted in Italy and one in Ireland, which raises concerns about the lack of generalisability to other settings. There is evidence of inconsistency among doses of myo-inositol, the timing of administration and study population. As a result, we downgraded the certainty of the evidence for many outcomes to low or very low certainty. Further studies for this promising antenatal intervention for preventing gestational diabetes are encouraged and should include pregnant women of different ethnicities and varying risk factors. Myo-inositol at different doses, frequency and timing of administration, should be compared with placebo, diet and exercise, and pharmacological interventions. Long-term follow-up should be considered and outcomes should include potential harms, including adverse effects.",

We aimed to determine the rates of individual adverse events (AEs) related to 3 studied doses of tirzepatide. We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis including 5 databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science) for all clinical trials reporting AEs related to tirzepatide. The safety data from individual studies were extracted and analyzed through meta-regression to assess rates of individual AEs.

Glomerular hyperfiltration was identified based on the age- and sex-specific distribution of measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) by 99mTc-DTPA dynamic renal scintigraphy. The primary outcome was a composite of doubling of serum creatinine, end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), or cardiorenal death. The kidney-specific outcome was a composite of doubling of serum creatinine, ESKD, or renal death.

Individuals from neighborhoods that were the most walkable (score 15.26-20.0) were compared with those from neighborhoods that were less walkable (score <15.26) defined per national EPA recommendations. The outcomes were glycemic control, including A1c <6.0% and <6.5%, measured both in early and late pregnancy, and mean change in A1c across pregnancy. Modified Poisson regression and linear regression were used, respectively, and adjusted for maternal age, body mass index at delivery, parity, race and ethnicity as a social determinant of health, insurance status, baseline A1c, gestational age at A1c measurement in early and late pregnancy, and diabetes type. Among 417 pregnant individuals (33% type 1, 67% type 2 diabetes), 10% were living in the most walkable communities. All 417 individuals underwent A1c assessment in early pregnancy (median gestational age 9.7 weeks IQR 7.4, 14.1), and 376 underwent repeat A1c in late pregnancy (median gestational age 30.4 weeks, IQR 27.8, 33.6). Pregnant individuals living in the most walkable communities were more likely to have an A1c <6.0% in early pregnancy (15% vs. 8% aRR 1.46 95% CI 1.00-2.16), as well as an A1c <6.5% in late pregnancy compared to those living in less walkable communities (13% vs. 9% aRR 1.33 95% CI 1.08-1.63). For individuals living in the most walkable communities, the median A1c was 7.5 (IQR 6.0, 9.4) in early pregnancy and 5.9 (IQR 5.4, 6.4) in late pregnancy. For those living in less walkable communities, the median A1c was 7.3 (IQR 6.2, 9.2) in early pregnancy and 6.2 (IQR 5.6, 7.1) in late pregnancy. Change in A1c across pregnancy was not associated with walkability. Pregnant individuals with pregestational diabetes living in more walkable communities had better glycemic control in both early and late pregnancy. Whether community-level interventions to enhance neighborhood walkability can improve glycemic control in pregnancy requires further study.",

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophic factor expressed in several tissues, including the brain, gut, and pancreas. Activation of the BDNFTrkBCREB reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis, induces hepatic insulin signal transduction, and protects against pancreatic beta-cell loss in diabetes mellitus (DM). Several studies have investigated the possible association between BDNF and DM and its complications, but the results have been conflicting. In the present study, we aimed at systematically reviewing the literature on the serum and plasma levels of BDNF in DM and its subgroups such as T2DM, DM patients with depression, and patients with retinopathy. A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. We identified 28 eligible studies and calculated the standardized mean difference (SMD) of outcomes as an effect measure. The meta-analysis included 2734 patients with DM and 6004 controls. Serum BDNF levels were significantly lower in patients with DM vs. controls (SMD -1.00, P<0.001). Plasma BDNF levels were not different in patients with DM compared with controls. When conducting subgroup analysis, serum BDNF levels were lower among patients with T2DM (SMD -1.26, P<0.001), DM and depression (SMD -1.69, P<0.001), and patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) vs. controls (SMD -1.03, P 0.01). Serum BDNF levels were lower in patients with DM, T2DM, DM with depression, and DM and DR than the controls. Our findings are in line with the hypothesis that decreased BDNF levels might impair glucose metabolism and contribute to the pathogenesis of DM and its complications.",

Plant-based diets are growing in popularity worldwide due to the importance of reducing the populations ecological footprint as well as an emerging role in the prevention and treatment of chronic human diseases. In adults, plant-based diets have been shown to be beneficial for preventing and controlling conditions that are common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), such as obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and metabolic acidosis. Emerging evidence suggests that the higher fiber content of plant-based diets may help to modulate production of uremic toxins through beneficial shifts in the gut microbiome. The effects of the plant-based diet on progression of CKD remain controversial, and there are no data to support this in children. However, knowledge that the bioavailability of potassium and phosphorus from plant-based foods is reduced has led to recent changes in international kidney-friendly diet recommendations for children with CKD. The new guidelines advise that high potassium fruits and vegetables should no longer be automatically excluded from the kidney-friendly diet. In fact, a plant-based diet can be safely implemented in children with CKD through building the diet around whole, high fiber foods, avoiding processed foods and using recommended cooking methods to control potassium. The health benefits of the plant-based diet compared to omnivorous diets in children with CKD need investigation.",

Diabetes and its complications cause a heavy disease burden globally. Identifying exposures, risk factors and molecular processes causally associated with the development of diabetes can provide important evidence bases for disease prevention and spur novel therapeutic strategies. Mendelian randomisation (MR), an epidemiological approach that uses genetic instruments to infer causal associations between an exposure and an outcome, can be leveraged to complement evidence from observational and clinical studies. This narrative review aims to summarise the evidence on potential causal risk factors for diabetes by integrating published MR studies on type 1 and 2 diabetes, and to reflect on future perspectives of MR studies on diabetes. Despite the genetic influence on type 1 diabetes, few MR studies have been conducted to identify causal exposures or molecular processes leading to increased disease risk. In type 2 diabetes, MR analyses support causal associations of somatic, mental and lifestyle factors with development of the disease. These studies have also identified biomarkers, some of them derived from the gut microbiota, and molecular processes leading to increased disease risk. These studies provide valuable data to better understand disease pathophysiology and explore potential therapeutic targets. Because genetic association studies have mostly been restricted to participants of European descent, multi-ancestry cohorts are needed to examine the role of different types of physical activity, dietary components, metabolites, protein biomarkers and gut microbiome in diabetes development.",

Part of VA\u2019s 1997 strategic plan was to increase health insurance payments and other collections to help fund an increased health care workload. The potential for increased workload occurred in part because the Veterans\u2019 Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 authorized VA to provide certain medical care services not previously available to higher-income veterans or those without service-connected disabilities. VA expected that the majority of the costs of their care would be covered by collections from third-party payments, copayments, and deductibles. These veterans increased from about 4 percent of all veterans treated in fiscal year 1996 to about a quarter of VA\u2019s total patient workload in fiscal year 2002. VA can bill insurers for treatment of conditions that are not a result of injuries or illnesses incurred or aggravated during military service. However, VA cannot bill them for health care conditions that result from military service, nor is it generally authorized to collect from Medicare or Medicaid, or from health maintenance organizations when VA is not a participating provider. To collect from health insurers, VA uses five related processes to manage the information needed to bill and collect.

Information reporting is a widely accepted practice for increasing taxpayer compliance. Under U.S. law, some types of transactions are required to be reported to the IRS by third parties who make payments to, or sometimes receive payments from, individual taxpayers. Typically, information returns represent income paid to the taxpayer, such as wages or bank account interest. After tax returns are filed, the IRS then matches the amounts reported on information returns to the amounts reported on the taxpayer\u2019s return. For any differences, the IRS may send a notice to the taxpayer requesting an explanation. If the taxpayer does not respond to the notice, the IRS may make an additional assessment. For fiscal year 2010, the IRS received over 2.7 billion information returns, sent 5.5 million notices on differences between information returns and tax returns, and assessed an additional $20.7 billion in taxes, interest, and penalties. Withholding. Withholding is a widely accepted practice to increase taxpayer compliance. Under U.S. law, employers must withhold income tax from the wages paid to employees. Withholding from salaries requires wage earners to pay enough tax during the tax year to assure that they will not face a large payment at year end. Also, withholding can be required as a backup to information reporting if a payee fails to furnish a correct taxpayer identification number (TIN). If the payee refuses to furnish a TIN, the payer generally withholds 28 percent of the amount of the payment\u2014 for example, interest payments on a bank account\u2014and remits that amount to the IRS.

In addition, a 1997 IRS internal study found that actions taken against lower-level employees more closely conformed to the IRS table of penalties than actions taken against higher-graded employees. However, because of dissimilarities in the types of offenses and incomplete case files, these data do not necessarily prove disparate treatment. Agencies must consider many factors, such as the nature and seriousness of the offense; the employee\u2019s job level and type of employment; whether the offense was intentional, technical, or inadvertent; the employee\u2019s past disciplinary record; and the notoriety of the offense or its impact upon the reputation of the agency, in deciding what penalty, if any, should be imposed in any given case. IRS recognized that problems have hindered the processing and resolution of employee misconduct cases and has begun revamping its disciplinary systems. For the period we studied, IRS tracked disciplinary cases for GS and SES employees in different systems. The Office of Labor Relations (OLR), which is the personnel office for non-SES staff, handled GS cases. It tracked these cases in the Automated Labor and Employee Relations Tracking System (ALERTS), although IRS officials told us that ALERTS data were often missing or incomplete.

In 1995, crop insurance premiums were about $1.5 billion. USDA\u2019s Risk Management Agency administers the federal crop insurance program through FCIC. Federal crop insurance offers farmers two primary types of insurance coverage. The first\u2014called catastrophic insurance\u2014provides protection against extreme crop losses for the payment of a $50 processing fee, whereas the second\u2014called buyup insurance\u2014provides protection against more typical smaller crop losses in exchange for a premium paid by the farmer. FCIC conducts the program primarily through private insurance companies that sell and service federal crop insurance\u2014both catastrophic and buyup\u2014for the federal government and retain a portion of the insurance risk. FCIC also offers catastrophic insurance through the local offices of USDA\u2019s Farm Service Agency. FCIC pays the companies a fee, called an administrative expense reimbursement, that is intended to reimburse the companies for the expenses reasonably associated with selling and servicing crop insurance to farmers. The reimbursement is calculated as a percentage of the premiums received, regardless of the expenses incurred by the companies. Beginning in 1994, companies were required to report expenses in a consistent format following standard industry guidelines to provide FCIC with a basis for establishing future reimbursement rates. For buyup crop insurance, FCIC reduced the administrative expense reimbursement from a base rate of 34 percent of the premiums on policies sold from 1988 through 1991 to 31 percent of the premiums from 1994 through 1996.

Academic standards, which describe what students should know and be able to do at different grade levels in different subjects, help guide school systems in their choice of curriculum and help teachers plan for classroom instruction. Assessments, which states use to measure student progress in achieving the standards, are required to be administered by states.

In addition, DLA performs five other supply-related business functions: distributing materiel from DLA and service-owned inventories, purchasing fuels for DOD and the U.S. government, storing strategic materiel, marketing surplus DOD materiel for reuse and disposal, and providing numerous information services, such as item cataloging, for DOD and the U.S. government, as well as selected foreign governments. These six business functions are managed by field commands that report to and support the agency\u2019s central command authority. In 2000, DLA refocused its logistics mission from that of a supplier of materiel to a manager of supply chain relationships. To support this transition, the agency developed a strategic plan (known as DLA 21) to reengineer and modernize its operations. Among the goals of DLA 21 are to optimize inventories, improve efficiency, increase effectiveness through organizational redesign, reduce inventories, and modernize business systems. DLA relies on over 650 systems to support warfighters by allowing access to global inventories. Whether it is ensuring that there is enough fuel to service an aircraft fleet, providing sufficient medical supplies to protect and treat military personnel, or supplying ample food rations to our soldiers on the frontlines, information technology plays a key role in ensuring that Defense Department agencies are prepared for their missions.

DOD has made significant investments in its military prepositioning programs, totaling several billion dollars in annual acquisition costs. In addition, the services have collectively used an average of over $1 billion each year to operate and maintain these assets. For example, in fiscal year 2005, the Army spent $386.1 million for storage and maintenance of prepositioned assets, including $76.5 million for assets in South Korea and $38.3 million for assets in Southwest Asia. Prepositioned assets have been used extensively to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Marine Corps used equipment from two of its three prepositioned squadrons to support these operations. The Army used nearly all of its prepositioned ship stocks and land-based stocks in Kuwait and Qatar, in addition to drawing some equipment from Europe. Military equipment and infrastructure are often located in corrosive environments that increase the deterioration of assets and shorten their useful life.

As shown in the figure, estimated costs for the major space acquisition programs have increased by about $10.9 billion from initial estimates for fiscal years 2008 through 2013. The declining investment in the later years is the result of the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program no longer being considered a major acquisition program and the cancellation and proposed cancellation of two development efforts which would have significantly increased DOD\u2019s major space acquisition investment. Figures 2 and 3 reflect differences in total life-cycle costs and unit costs for satellites from the time the programs officially began to their most recent cost estimate.

For centuries people have crossbred related plant or animal species to develop useful new varieties or hybrids with desirable traits, such as better taste or increased productivity. Traditional crossbreeding, however, can be very time-consuming because it may require breeding several generations to obtain a desired trait and breed out numerous unwanted characteristics. Genetic engineering techniques allow faster development of new crop or livestock varieties, since the genes for a given trait can be readily introduced into a plant or animal species to produce a new variety incorporating that specific trait. Additionally, genetic engineering increases the range of traits available for developing new varieties by allowing genes from totally unrelated species to be incorporated into a particular plant or animal variety. To date, the principal biotechnology products marketed have been certain genetically engineered field crops (see slide 2). No genetically engineered animals have yet been approved, and only a modest number of plant products obtained from biotechnology have been marketed.

At the time of the Gulf War, U.S. forces were armed with both nonself-destruct and self-destruct land mines, and U.S. policy allowed them to use both types. Today, however, U.S. presidential policy limits the U.S. forces\u2019 use of nonself-destruct M-14 and M-16 antipersonnel land mines (see fig. 6 in app. II) to Korea.

These included weaknesses in screening passengers and baggage, controlling access to secure areas at airports, and protecting air traffic control computer systems and facilities. To address these and other weaknesses, ATSA created the Transportation Security Administration and established security requirements for the new agency with mandated deadlines. Before September 2001, screeners, who were then hired by the airlines, often failed to detect threat objects located on passengers or in their carry- on luggage. Principal causes of screeners\u2019 performance problems were rapid turnover and insufficient training. As we previously reported, turnover rates exceeded 100 percent a year at most large airports, leaving few skilled and experienced screeners, primarily because of low wages, limited benefits, and repetitive, monotonous work. In addition, before September 2001, controls for limiting access to secure areas of airports, including aircraft, did not always work as intended. As we reported in May 2000, our special agents used fictitious law enforcement badges and credentials to gain access to secure areas, bypass security checkpoints at two airports, and walk unescorted to aircraft departure gates. The agents, who had been issued tickets and boarding passes, could have carried weapons, explosives, or other dangerous objects onto aircraft. DOT\u2019s Inspector General also documented numerous problems with airport access controls, and in one series of tests, nearly 7 out of every 10 attempts by the Inspector General\u2019s staff to gain access to secure areas were successful.

In addition, federal operations could be significantly disrupted by people-only events, such as an outbreak of severe acute respiratory illness (SARS). Such disruptions, particularly if prolonged, can lead to interruptions in essential government services.

First developed in the 1970s for use by police departments, Tasers differ from stun guns in that they can be fired from a distance and do not require contact with skin in order to work. Taser International has produced various models of Taser weapons including Air Tasers and the M-18, M-18L, M-26, X-26, and X-26C models. The M-18 and X-26C models are available to the civilian market. The M-26 and X-26 models are sold only to law enforcement agencies, the military, and more recently have been made available for use in maintaining aviation security. Both models, while varying in size, operate in the same manner and deliver approximately the same electrical charge. For the purposes of this report, Tasers refer to the M-26 and X-26 models. Figure 1 shows a picture of an M-26 model Taser, and figure 2 shows a picture of an X-26 model Taser. The Taser fires two metal barbs that are attached to wires, which can cover a distance of up to 25 feet. Once the barbs are embedded in an individual or on the individual\u2019s clothing, the weapon delivers an electrical charge of 50,000 volts through the wires to the barbs. This charge causes the muscles of the individual to involuntarily contract, which immediately incapacitates the individual for the duration of the shock, usually lasting about 5 seconds. The barbs need not be embedded in an individual\u2019s body in order to function. Because of the high voltage, an individual will be shocked even if the barbs are attached to an outer layer of clothing, such as a coat. If the barbs penetrate the skin, it is impossible to predict how deeply they will embed because of v",

Historically, many local utilities in the electricity sector built their own systems of power plants and electricity transmission and distribution lines to serve the needs of all consumers in their local areas. Similarly, natural gas companies built networks of pipelines to deliver natural gas from areas where it was produced to the markets where local distribution companies served all local customers. These local monopolies were overseen by regulators, who restricted the entry of new companies and also approved investments, approved prices paid by customers, and determined profits of these utilities. However, due to rising electricity prices and technological, economic, and policy developments beginning in the 1970s, the electricity and natural gas industries have restructured from a regulated environment to one that places greater reliance on competition to determine entry, investment, prices, and profits. The passage of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989, and subsequent FERC orders in 1985 and 1992 opened access to pipelines and required pipeline companies to completely separate transportation, storage, and sales services, all of which facilitated the shift of natural gas to more competitive markets. Similarly, the 1978 passage of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 and the 1992 passage of the Energy Policy Act facilitated restructuring in the electricity industry.

According to DOD\u2019s calculations, when all BRAC actions from those rounds are completed, no later than 2001, DOD will have reduced its domestic military basing structure by about 20 percent. DOD believes it needs to reduce its domestic basing infrastructure even further to bring it more into line with reductions in its force structure and funding levels and free up funds for other programs, including modernization. Consequently, in 1997 and 1998, the Secretary of Defense requested the Congress to authorize additional rounds of base closures. However, the Congress continues to have many questions about the four BRAC rounds and has not been willing to authorize additional ones to date. Some in the Congress, noting the lengthy time frame allowed for closures and realignments to be completed, have suggested that additional BRAC rounds should not be authorized until prior recommendations have been implemented and the effects of those decisions fully assessed. Some members have also raised questions about the adequacy of DOD\u2019s accounting for the costs and savings associated with BRAC decisions, including environmental restoration costs and other costs to the government not borne directly by DOD; the extent to which environmental restoration associated with BRAC might continue beyond 2001; and the economic impact on communities affected by closures and their ability to recover. DOD has characterized the four rounds of BRAC actions as representing about 20 percent of its major bases, producing decisions to close 97 out of 495 major domestic installations and many smaller ones and to realign many other facilities.

As shown in figure 1, in 1991, 1,327 lawsuits were filed; in 2012, that number had increased over 500 percent to 8,148. FLSA lawsuits can be filed by DOL on behalf of employees or by private individuals. Private FLSA lawsuits can either be filed by individuals or on behalf of a group of individuals in a type of lawsuit known as a \u201ccollective action\u201d. The court will generally certify whether a lawsuit meets the requirements to proceed as a collective action. The court may deny certification to a proposed collective action or decertify an existing collective action if the court determines that the plaintiffs are not \u201csimilarly situated\u201d with respect to the factual and legal issues to be decided. In such cases, the court may permit the members to individually file private FLSA lawsuits. Collective actions can serve to reduce the burden on courts and protect plaintiffs by reducing costs for individuals and incentivizing attorneys to represent workers in pursuit of claims under the law. They may also protect employers from facing the burden of many individual lawsuits; however, they can also be costly to employers because they may result in large amounts of damages. For fiscal year 2012, we found that an estimated 58 percent of the FLSA lawsuits filed in federal district court were filed individually, and 40 percent were filed as collective actions.
