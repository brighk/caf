\chapter{Production Deployment and Case Studies}
\label{ch:deployment}

\section{Introduction}

This chapter presents the production deployment of the Causal Autonomy Framework (CAF), demonstrating its practical applicability beyond experimental evaluation. We describe the system architecture, deployment considerations, and real-world case studies that validate CAF's effectiveness in production environments.
